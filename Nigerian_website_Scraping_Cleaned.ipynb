      "\n",
      "New entrants to the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), on Tuesday, drew valuable lessons from the hands-on experience of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the job in the last four years.\n",
      "The Lagos State helmsman shared perspectives and practical ideas on governance during an interaction with his governor colleagues at a three-day induction for new and returning governors held at the Presidential Banquet Hall, State House, Abuja.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu, who spoke on “Managing the Process of Governance: Insights for New Governors”, said the quality of transition would determine the extent to which a new administrator could hit the ground running.\n",
      "Some governors, the Lagos helmsman said, would be taking over from friendly predecessors and enjoy cordial transitions that would enable them find bearing of governance easily; others, he added, would have to contend with hostile transition teams of the outgoing administrations, which would give them a hard nut to crack upon inauguration.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu advised those facing hostile transition processes to play the cards available to them, while articulating their governing agenda to help them meander through the transition phase.\n",
      "He said: “The most significant and troubling challenges you will face as a new governor will not be anticipated. A lot of events will happen without warning. The ability to always be responsive, and to be able to quickly deploy mechanisms to attend to unexpected challenges will make a huge amount of difference. Negative news about your government and your person will receive more attention than positive developments, especially in social media.\n",
      "“It is, therefore, important to keep sharing and amplifying the positives, whilst also responding to the negatives with action. Lagos has a unique challenge, in that it enjoys the highest degree of media and social media visibility for obvious reasons. Lagos is the hub of the Nigerian traditional media. It also has the widest Internet coverage and the highest number of Internet users in the country.”\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu said setting a practicable governing agenda had empowered successive administrations in Lagos to quickly gain citizens’ acceptance. He advised the governors to consider setting a governing agenda that would have memorable acronyms and mantras.\n",
      "Lagos, the Governor cited, operates on THEMES agenda with ‘Greater Lagos’ mantra, while Ogun State projects governance activities by ISEYA, which literally means “let’s get on with work”.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu said the governing agenda would help drive focus since no administration can do everything at once, while also helping to streamline and organise government communications.\n",
      "He said government communications must be proactive, regular and simplified. Social media, he said, should be given attention as much as the traditional media, while leveraging technology for effective communication channels.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu said it was important to maintain engagements with critical stakeholders and development partners, including the presidency, colleagues- governors, legislature, National Economic Council (NEC), multilateral institutions.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu emphasised the role of Deputy Governor, saying any governor looking forward to a stable government should see his deputy as partner and not as spare tyre. \n",
      "He said: “From the moment you are elected, you already have one guaranteed member of the team – your Deputy Governor. The relationship between a Governor and a Deputy Governor is highly important and must be carefully managed as it can significantly impact the workings and efficiency of your government.\n",
      "“Managing and resolving conflicts and disputes is an important part of the work of any Governor. Conflicts will arise within the team, as well as in other areas of the Government that will need to be promptly resolved, to avoid dampening morale and impacting the collegial spirit required to succeed.”\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu also shared tips on budgeting and project execution, assembling cabinet and governance structure, administrative style and management, and appointment of political aides.\n",

      "    By Beatrice Akpala\n",
      "As the nation waits with great anticipation and amidst the political horse trading, political calculations, inner schemes and jostling for the various leadership positions of the yet to be inaugurated 10th National Assembly, the elected representatives from Cross River State, have made their position known as to whom to support to clinch the various positions, when eventually the National Assembly is inaugurated in June, 2023.The 10th National Assembly is unarguably the most anticipated Assembly in the history of Nigerian democracy.The very intimidating calibre of those angling for the positions is already public knowledge and their top notch political pedigree, experience and personal credentials will come into close focus.With the above anticipated scenario, every Nigerian expects to see viable and robust representation exhibited by their Representatives at all quarters and in effect, the performances of the representatives will definitely be called to question.It has therefore become quite compelling and imperative for the elected representatives from Cross River State, to take a practical decision amongst themselves on their unapologetic positions as they manoeuvre through the rather complicated process of choosing or supporting whoever for the exalted leadership positions of the incoming National Assembly.\n",
      "Conversely, their  decision must not only be ably guided by the desire to continuously put Cross River State in national reckoning but to also elect those who would in the long run, be supportive of federal government programmes and projects in the state.\n",
      "It was with this factors in mind that majority of the representatives from Cross River State irrespective of political party affiliations, have resolved that the party is supreme and they would continue to give their unalloyed loyalty and support to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). \n",
      "The State National Assembly members pledged to be at the centre of decision making and reiterated the fact that Cross River State stands as the only State in the entire South‐South region that is ruled by the All Progressives Congress and majority of the law makers are of the ruling party.\n",
      "In conformity with better reasoning therefore, they all resolved to continuously offer their unalloyed loyalty, solidarity and goodwill to the APC and its leader in the South ‐ South, Senator Prof. Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State.In doing this, the returning and potential law makers from the State believe very strongly in the ability and leadership credentials as well as the possibility of a resounding victory of Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen, whom they all described as an astute and very experienced public service administrator cum suave political figure.They reasoned and quite understandably too that his leadership of the National Assembly will surely reposition the 10th National Assembly and take it to a new and better height of legislative glory.\n",
      "Equally, the Cross River State legislators are of the opinion that the supremacy of the party must come to play and since Rt. Hon. Abbas Tajudeen is of the ruling party, he will, in conjunction with his colleagues and the bearings of his political sagacity, bring in new ethics and ably transform the national legislative body to a towering pedestal.\n",
      "The Cross River State House of Representatives elects also reiterated their preparedness to put up a workable and beneficial A Game to enable them to deliver on their mandate by making the good people of Cross River State see the benefits of their contributions in the National Assembly.\n",
      " The various elected representatives reasoned that it was in the same National Assembly that some representatives from other States cooperated with each other regardless of party differences to draw many developmental projects to their States and that they are all first of all Cross Riverians before their respective political affiliations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In unison and in deep appreciation of the fatherly roles and the effective leadership which enabled them to get elected, they all thanked His Excellency, Senator Prof Ben Ayade, Governor of Cross River State for providing them with the platform with which they are flourishing politically.\n",
      "With the grounds set for an epic legislative session that would produce the leadership of the two Chambers of the National Assembly, all hopes are hinged on the outlook, performance and results that will emerge from Cross River State representatives at the 10th National Assembly.\n",
