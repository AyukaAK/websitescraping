      "28 May 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/05/28/aregbesola-champions-easier-path-to-naturalisation-announces-brown-card-for-permanent-residency/\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign nationals with exceptional talent or those of African descent that wish to make Nigeria their home and those who desire to invest in Nigeria now can become Nigerians through a legal instrument called “The Brown Card.” This was announced by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, on Saturday, 27th May 2023 in Abuja during a ceremony to confer Nigerian Citizenship on 385 deserving adult foreign nationals from different countries.\n",
      " \n",
      "At the event, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister explained that although the Buhari administration approved the highest number of naturalised citizens in the country’s history, he was unhappy with the number and sought alternative paths for deserving foreigners to gain the right to become Nigerians. Ogbeni Aregbesola was emphatic that having smoother paths to citizenship for worthy foreigners is a great way to make Nigeria prosperous. \n",
      "In his words, “One of the objectives of this administration is to lay a solid socio-economic and political foundation that will elevate Nigeria into one of the 20 great economies of the world. To achieve this global vision, the government is determined to encourage and attract foreigners – investors, resourceful individuals and people with rare talents and unbounded energy – into the country.\n",
      "“Under our administration, the largest number of foreigners have been naturalised. Between 2011 and 2013, a total of 266 foreigners became Nigerians. In 2017, 335 people took up Nigerian citizenship. But last year, 286 foreigners and today at this ceremony, 385, making a total of 1006 have acquired Nigerian citizenship.\n",
      "“I am still not pleased with this figure. In Europe and America, thousands of foreigners are inducted into citizenship every year. They do this to attract youths and people in their prime who would like to contribute to the development of their countries. Let’s face it. There is a limit to your expectations from a non-citizen and it is reasonable to expect an average person to be more loyal to his or her country.\n",
      "“The bane of the smooth pathway to Nigerian citizenship however is the constitutional requirement of continuous residency in Nigeria for 15 years. This is a huge disincentive, considering that in the United States and most European countries, it is five years. Some of these countries have made a habit of snatching young and resourceful brains, through easy pathways, to obtain quality migration to their countries.\n",
      "“I will therefore urge the relevant institutions of state to reconsider this in the next effort at amendment to the constitution. We ought to have easier pathways to citizenship for foreigners than currently obtains.”\n",
      "The Minister also said it was imperative for Nigeria to make it easy for foreigner husbands of Nigerian women to gain citizenship. He also explained what led to the emergence of the Brown Card.\n",
      "“My Ministry sought and got the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council, to execute new pathways to permanent residency for eligible foreign nationals. I am happy therefore to announce the Brown Card, as the legal instrument to Permanent Residency.\n",
      "“The Minister of Interior is now invested with the authority to confer Permanent Residency on non-Nigerian persons, enabling such beneficiaries to live and work in Nigeria without the requirement of renewal every five years, as was the case.”\n",
      "Ogbeni Aregbesola said those who are qualified for this new instrument of Permanent Residency are as follows:\n",
      "1. Foreign nationals of African descent who desire to make Nigeria their homeland through the ‘Privilege of Return’\n",
      "2. Foreign nationals who desire to invest in Nigeria in line with established guidelines\n",
      "3. Foreign nationals who had demonstrated exceptional talents, knowledge and skills in rare fields of Science, Technology, Medicine, Engineering, the Arts, Sports and other areas as might be determined from time to time.\n",
      "4. Male foreign nationals married to Nigerian women for a minimum period of one year.\n",
      "The specific details for application and processing will be announced later by the Ministry of Interior and Nigeria Immigration Service.\n",

      "\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s attendance at the 10th German-Nigeria Business Forum in Berlin was a pivotal moment witnessing the signing of two groundbreaking Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between Union Bank of Nigeria and DWS Group. These MoUs aim to revolutionize the landscape of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in both Nigeria and Germany.\n",
      "The specifics of the first MoU delineate a pathway for energy export from Nigeria to Germany, utilizing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the European Union – African Union Partnership. This agreement empowers Union Bank of Nigeria to oversee the exportation of solar-generated electricity to Germany via established conduits such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP) and the Trans-Saharan Power Transmission Corridor (TSPTC). In tandem, DWS Group commits technical and financial support, fortifying the development and operation of these solar plants. \n",
      "The second agreement marks a significant investment of $500 million by DWS Group into Nigerian renewable energy projects, mainly focusing on solar initiatives. This is a welcome boost for Nigeria’s economy, as it will create new opportunities for income, employment, and improved access to affordable electricity. It will also help Nigeria diversify its energy mix, reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate its environmental impact. Union Bank of Nigeria and local stakeholders will work together to identify, finance, and implement these projects.\n",
      "These agreements are not only beneficial for Nigeria and Germany, but also for the world at large. They align with both countries’ commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure a sustainable energy future for all. They also reflect the spirit of international collaboration, which is essential for tackling the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the energy transition and climate crisis.\n",
      "President Tinubu deserves praise for his visionary leadership and his unwavering support for these agreements. He has shown that Nigeria is not only a willing partner, but also a leader in renewable energy, particularly solar power. He has also reaffirmed Nigeria’s determination to embrace a sustainable energy future, and to cooperate with other nations in achieving this goal.\n",
      "The signing of these agreements is a milestone in Nigerian-German relations, and a testament to the strength and potential of their partnership. It is also a sign of hope and optimism for the future of renewable energy, and a step towards a brighter, greener future.\n",

      "Nigeria, a nation teeming with potential and diversity, stands at a pivotal juncture in its history. With a population exceeding 200 million and a GDP surpassing $400 billion, it’s undeniable that Nigeria is a regional powerhouse in Africa. However, the complexities and challenges that have punctuated its bilateral relations with the world have been undeniable, raising questions about the country’s future trajectory.\n",
      "Bilateral relations serve as the lifeblood of a nation’s diplomacy, playing a pivotal role in shaping its economic development, security, and global standing. In the Nigerian context, these relations have not always been smooth, often tainted by conflict and discord with neighboring countries and key trading partners. Yet, President Bola Tinubu, who assumed office in May 2023 following a contentious election, has made it abundantly clear that enhancing Nigeria’s bilateral relations is at the forefront of his agenda. \n",
      "One of President Tinubu’s notable approaches has been an extensive outreach to countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This approach seeks to strengthen existing relationships and uncover new opportunities for trade, investment, and cooperation. High-profile meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been instrumental in fortifying Nigeria’s global connections.\n",
      "Moreover, Nigeria’s participation in various multilateral forums and initiatives underscores its dedication to global peace, security, development, and cooperation. President Tinubu’s leadership within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), co-hosting the Africa Investment Forum, involvement in the G20 Summit, support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), endorsement of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations illustrate the nation’s proactive role in addressing regional and global concerns.\n",
      "The results of these endeavors have been palpable, with Nigeria witnessing substantial improvements in its diplomatic relations, trade and investment, and security. It has also garnered greater respect on the international stage as it plays a constructive role in addressing critical issues. Yet, challenges remain and room for further improvement is evident.\n",
      "To continue this positive trajectory, Nigeria must maintain its pursuit of reforms that enhance governance, economic stability, infrastructure, and human capital. Striking a delicate balance between its interests and values, especially in situations where they diverge, is essential. Diversifying partnerships and engagements, including with less familiar or friendly nations, will further fortify its position.\n",
      "Nigeria’s bilateral relations serve as a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The ultimate objective is to transform Nigeria into a prosperous, secure, democratic, and influential nation. Under President Tinubu’s leadership, the country is taking significant strides toward this goal. In the dynamic world of international relations, Nigeria is firmly positioning itself as the giant of Africa, ready to embrace the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\n",

      "Imagine a world where no one goes hungry, where Africa feeds itself and the rest of the world. This is not a fantasy, but a possibility, thanks to a historic $1 billion pledge for Nigeria’s agriculture.\n",
      "This game-changing investment, led by Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), will create Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs) in Nigeria and 12 other African countries. These zones will boost productivity, value addition, and market access for farmers and agribusinesses. \n",
      "The AfDB and its partners have committed $1.5 billion to support SAPZs in Africa, with Nigeria receiving the largest share. Nigeria, being the most populous and largest economy on the continent, has the potential to transform its agriculture sector and catalyze regional development.\n",
      "With 283 million people still suffering from hunger in Africa, there is an urgent need to harness the continent’s vast agricultural resources for food security and self-reliance. This investment comes at a crucial time to address these challenges and promote sustainable development.\n",
      "The visionary leadership demonstrated by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Macky Sall of Senegal, and Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt deserves recognition. Their commitment to progress and development heralds a new era of leadership in Africa.\n",
      "The ambitious goals outlined by Vice President Kashim Shettima for wheat and rice production, involving heat-tolerant seeds, expanded irrigation, farmer support, and accessible financing, are crucial steps towards achieving self-sufficiency in Nigeria’s agriculture.\n",
      "The SAPZs will also have a dedicated authority to address regulatory issues and create an investor-friendly environment. By streamlining regulations and providing a conducive atmosphere, Nigeria aims to attract both domestic and foreign investors, fostering innovation and technology transfer in the sector.\n",
      "The billion-dollar pledge for Nigeria’s SAPZs is not just a financial support but a transformative effort for the nation’s agriculture. It offers an opportunity to unlock Africa’s agricultural potential, not only for self-sufficiency but also as a potential food provider to the world. It highlights the importance of visionary leadership and has the potential to drive Nigeria towards food security, ushering in a new era of agricultural prosperity for the entire continent.\n",
      "In conclusion, the $1 billion pledge for Nigeria’s SAPZs is a significant step towards transforming the country’s agriculture sector. It presents a unique opportunity to unlock Nigeria’s agricultural potential while serving as an example for other African countries. With visionary leaders at the helm and strategic investments, Africa can overcome food insecurity, drive economic growth, and become a major contributor to global food production. Let us celebrate this historic initiative and look forward to a future where agriculture takes center stage in Africa’s progress.\n",

      "Mr. Shonubi expressed the President’s worries about the impact on the average person, as local economic activities are still influenced by parallel market exchange rates.\n",

      "Some financial experts have commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its decision to redesign the naira, saying that it would have positive effect on the economy.\n",
      "The experts spoke in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Thursday. \n",
      "They spoke against the backdrop of announcement by the CBN that new designs of the N200, N500 and N1,000 denominations would be produced and circulated on Dec. 15.\n",
      "According to Prof. Umhe Uwaleke, a financial economist and professor of capital market at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, the decision will be positive for the economy in the medium to long term.\n",
      "Uwaleke said the measure would go a long way to ensure that the naira in circulation outside the banking system were brought into the banking system.\n",
      "He said the measure would also provide enough liquidity for banks, and more money for the banks to lend.\n",
      "“The measure does not amount to demonetisation of big currency notes often carried out by central banks to curb black money and corruption.\n",
      "“But it will go a long way in ensuring that a lot of naira notes circulating outside the banks are crowded in.\n",
      "“If it leads to large deposits in banks, it means the banks will have more money to lend which may reduce interest rates.\n",
      "“Perhaps more importantly, with increased currency in circulation now in the vault of banks, I expect to see improvement in monetary policy transmission,” he said.\n",
      "Uwaleke said it might also have the effect of reducing speculative attacks on the naira in the parallel market in the medium term.\n",
      "“I expect that the Financial Intelligence Unit will be on the look out for huge deposits as a way of monitoring illegitimate transactions.\n",
      "“Despite the huge cost involved in changing currency notes, I think it’s time to sanitise the system, especially now that electioneering activities have kicked off,” he said.\n",
      "He, however, said the deadline of Jan. 31, 2023 was too short, considering the number of naira denominations involved, urging the CBN to consider extending it.\n",
      "An economist, Dr Tope Fasua, also said the measure would have significant effect on the economy, adding that it was essentially about “black money.”\n",
      "He suggested that the CBN should take such measures more frequently.\n",
      "“When central banks do this, they try to pull in monies people are hiding; illegal money, corruption money, kidnapping money. Nigeria has managed to become a hub for these kinds of illegalities.\n",
      "“I will even suggest that the CBN does this more often, maybe every 10 years. You will see a scenario where the banks are awash with liquidity.\n",
      "“There are many people sitting on billions in naira, and even in dollars. The CBN should also see how it can pull in the dollars,” he said.\n",
      "Fasua advised that the idea of individuals operating personal domiciliary bank accounts should be banned, adding that nobody needed it.\n",
      "“People are speculating against their own currency in their own country. That is not allowed in any economy.\n",
      "“They should pull in illegal, black naira and then see how they can pull in illegal dollars. The CBN can control these things through the Deposit Money Banks,” he said.\n",
      "However, Mr Okechukwu Unegbu, a financial expert, and past President of the Chattered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), said redesigning the naira was not the most important problem facing the economy.\n",
      "Unegbu, said the apex bank should have simply ensured that the scarce lower naira denominations, like N100 and N200 were readily available by printing more. (NAN)\n",

      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2022/08/22/fg-will-stop-paying-petrol-subsidy-june-2023-minister/\n",
      "\n",
      "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed has disclosed the plans of the Federal Government to stop payment of petrol subsidy in June 2023.\n",
      "Ahmed disclosed this when she appeared before the house of representatives ad hoc committee investigating petrol subsidy. \n",
      "The FG had had made known its projection to spend N6.7 trillion for payment of petrol subsidy in 2023.\n",
      "However, Ahmed confirmed that the projected amount has been cut down to N3.35 trillion as contained in the 2023-2035 medium term expenditure framework and fiscal strategy paper (MTEF&FSP).\n",
      "She said, “One thing that stands out in the MTEF was that if the nation holds on to fuel subsidy as it is designed now, we will be incurring — from January to December — a subsidy cost of N6.4 trillion. But we suggested to the federal executive council (FEC) and the council approved that, maybe, we could look at the option of exiting the subsidy regime half-year. So, if we did that, then the cost would be N3.35 trillion, which is half of the N6.7 trillion,”\n",
      "Ahmed added that the subsidy plan was not sustainable, saying that it might compel the government to borrowing in 2023.\n",
      "She noted that the subsidy scheme was putting the country’s finance in jeopardy, but that plan is underway to get the country out of the subsidy regime as soon as possible.\n",
      "The finance minister also gave a rundown of the withdrawals from the consolidated revenue fund (CRF) and the excess crude account (ECA) for payments to oil marketers during the subsidy regime.\n",
      "“Deduction of PMS under recovery shortfall by NNPC for the period 2013 to 2022: We are reporting that there is a total sum of N4.436 trillion which was deducted as PMS under-recovery by NNPC for the period January 2013 to December 2021.\n",
      "“In this report, we are reporting the sum of N1.774 trillion has been paid to independent oil marketers as subsidies from 2013 to 2016.\n",
      "“I will like to call the attention of the committee to note that the total sum of N6.210 trillion – that is the N4.4 trillion plus the N1.774 trillion – was expended on PMS under-recovery by NNPC as well as payment of subsidy to independent oil marketers from 2013 to 2021.\n",
      "“I want to report on the funding of subsidy payments to independent oil marketers for 2013 to 2016. Payments that have been made to them were directly from the domestic excess crude account (ECA) through the reduction of sovereign debts instruments that we call the SDIs.\n",
      "“The SDIs are negotiable short-term instruments that were issued by the government at that time to give marketers comfort and enable them access financial support from their bankers for the importation of PMS. The instrument was approved by the then president in 2010.\n",
      "“It is also important to note that there were instances where funds were transferred from the consolidated revenue fund (CRF) to the domestic excess crude account for subsidy payments.\n",
      "“For 2015, there are two instances: N31 billion from the FGN’s excess domestic account, transferred from the CRF. Again in 2015, N156.1 billion transferred from the CRF in another instance to the domestic excess crude account,” she said.\n",

      "\n",
      "By Temitope Ajayi\n",
      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",
      "When the world comes together to take actions on achieving a common goal and proffer collective solutions to a nagging global concern, there are parties involved from government, private sector, civil society, media and multilateral institutions. The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "–          Collected N300 million as kickback from bank\n",
      "–          Supplied sand mixed with chemical as fertilizer \n",
      "The Minister of Defense (state), Dr. Muhammad Bello Matawalle has reacted to the recent allegations by the current governor of Zamfara state, Dauda Lawal Dare about his past government, clearing that the governor is after him because he rejected his attempt to scam him while he was governor.\n",
      "Matawalle who is the immediate past governor of the state said he has done his best for the state, and the current governor is angry and envying his ministerial position. He added that he has done some things in the past that made Dauda angry, which made him cook allegations against him.\n",
      "Speaking to DCL Hausa in an interview, the Minister said instead of spreading fake allegations, the governor should focus his attention on finding lasting solutions to the problems of the state, as he rightly did during his tenure.\n",
      "“I didn’t intend to talk about these issues, but it has become necessary for people to know. He is mounting pressure to just blackmail me, not knowing that I have laid a foundation that can never be destroyed in both Zamfara state and the National level. We have done our best for the state in the past four years and the good people of the state can attest to that,” the Defense Minister said.\n",
      "The former governor further disclosed that he had trusted Dauda Lawal with some projects while he was the governor of Zamfara State, but “He deceived and cheated on me and the state.”\n",
      "‘Why Lawal Dare is after me’\n",
      "According to him, the main reason why the present governor is angry with him is because he (Governor Lawal Dauda) attempted to hijack some contracts to supply fertilizer and bank loans to the state when the minister was the governor.\n",
      "“Lawal Dare (Dauda) came to me when I was the governor that he brought a bank that will give us a loan of N30 billion. But at the end he connived and collected N300 million from the bank as a commission, which was later confiscated by EFCC.\n",
      "“He also came to me that he wanted to supply fertilizer to me and we signed a contract of over N4 billion. But for over seven months he couldn’t. He later told me that he doesn’t have money and a certificate. I gave him a certificate but still he couldn’t. Yet, I also agreed that he should bring 120 trailers at the cost of N504 million, but he couldn’t,” he said.\n",
      "Matawalle added that, “That time he could only bring 10 trailers and had been disturbing that I should give him money, but I refused because I wanted him to supply the whole fertilizer before we could settle him. But to my surprise, after distributing the fertilizer, it was discovered that he just mixed sand with chemicals. Which meant he deceived us. This was the beginning of our problem with him.”\n",
      "The minister added that another major issue between them is how he emerged as  Minister of Defense, he explained that Dauda Lawal did not want him to get this position and thus has been mounting allegations and accusations against him ever since.\n",
      "“He is angry that I am now a minister, not knowing that I have gone far. I am a minister and I will focus my attention on delivering my assigned responsibilities. All my life I don’t have time to fight or belong to where I am not needed. That is why I didn’t want to talk about him, but I have to because the noise is too much. I have to let the world know what is actually happening,” he added.\n",
      "Focus on Zamfara and stop playing our people\n",
      "Matawalle further advised the state governor to stop deceiving his people and requested he should focus on his primary assignment of leading the state and ensuring that the security of life of the people of Zamfara state.\n",
      "“Instead of spreading lies against me, Lawal Dauda should focus on the state. He should cooperate with the security personnel in finding lasting solutions to the security challenges bedeviling our dear state. This is what I did in my tenure.\n",
      "“We all know what is happening in our state for a long time. Both of us inherited challenges of security, but our focus should all be on ending it. I have been nice to him. Even when he became the governor, I prayed for him to be the reason for finding lasting solutions to the security challenges in our state.”\n",
      "According to Matawalle, “We all love Zamfara state that is why we want to support him. We are after the development of the state. So I think it is high time that he should concentrate on the state, not spreading mere allegations and rumors.\n",
      "“For someone who said he loves Zamfara state, he is not staying in the state. I have been staying there despite the security challenges. Anytime there is a problem he will be nowhere to be found in the state. Even in the recent crisis, we attempted to go to the state, but when we called him, he told us he is in the US. At a time when you are facing security challenges, but you are busy touring Europe.”\n",
      "He debunked other allegations by the governor on the claims of spending sums on Airport, education, Ruga and some road projects across the state, as well as the recent medicines that arrived the state that were earlier purchased by the Matwalle administration.\n",
      "“There was a time when Zamfara was the last in education, but during my tenure we were able to improve and became fourteenth. We all have the records. We know how he destroyed our roads and other legacies mainly to paint us black in the mind of Zamfara people. What are all these? Doesn’t he have projects to do for the state?\n",
      "“Dauda let me tell you that Matawalle is a minister. You cannot remove me from the position, and you cannot force someone to remove me either. Everything has its time. I want to advise you to go and work for the people of Zamfara state. Stop spending their money unnecessarily.”\n",

      "Excellence needs no hype, makeover, or agitprop. Good work manifests itself in palpable reality. The security bent of the Tinubu administration is an exercise of deliberate, coordinated, meticulous and prescient deployment of strategies and actions to secure Nigeria. It is securing Nigeria pluck by pluck — with inexorable courage, purpose, and urgency. \n",
      "A large part of success in security operations lies in ICC – interagency cooperation and coordination. What more demonstrates this plank than the synergised effort between the Department of State Services and the army in precluding what could have been a devastating blow, with a sludge of casualties in Kano?\n",
      "On November 3, the symbiotic effort of the Nigerian Army and the DSS led to the successful foiling of an attack on Kano by insurgents. The insurgents had been machinating a marquee attack, that could, perhaps, dampen citizens’ confidence, on the State. A detachment of soldiers and DSS operatives swooped on the sanctuary of the subversives in a dawn blitz in Gezawa Local Government Area of Kano State, arresting the henchmen.\n",
      "The joint team recovered five AK-47 rifles, five AK-47 rifle magazines, one rocket-propelled gun (RPG), five RPG bombs, six hand grenades, five pairs of desert camouflage uniforms, 10 pairs of magazine pouches and some improvised-explosive device (IED) making materials.\n",
      "Obviously, the success of this operation is implicit in the cooperation and coordination between the army and the DSS, as well as in the actioning of intelligence. What imperils security anywhere in the world is, partly, interagency rivalry and the absence of coordination — when intelligence is available, but actioning is a challenge owing to some contentions.\n",
      "On November 2, the allied effort of the army and the police resulted in the rescuing of two corps members. Bandits had kidnapped the corps members who were transiting from Edo State in Yargoje community, Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. But the purposive and united endeavour of the security agencies led to the safe return of the hostages.\n",
      "Interagency cooperation and coordination (ICC) is pivotal for securing Nigeria. It is elemental for achieving the priority objective of the administration, which is strengthening national security for peace and security.\n",
      "Since July 2023, the security forces have chalked up reasonable gains against subversives without a noising of the winnings. There is a fillip in security operations across the country. Since the past week, for instance, there has been intensive air strikes against the troublers of our nation.\n",
      "In the north-west, the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji on November 1, conducted a slew of successful air strikes in Kankara Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State, targeting the hermitage of a terrorist kingpin, who is responsible for a chain of terrorist acts and banditry across Kankara and adjacent LGAs in the state.\n",
      "The air strikes removed clusters of refuge used as hideaways by the kingpin and his gang, effectively dismantling their base of operation. Only Very few survivors escaped the furry of the Nigeria Air force.\n",
      "In the north-east, precision air strikes by the air component of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) on November 3, led to the elimination of several terrorists at their rendezvous, near Degbawa in Goza Local Government Area of Borno State. The terrorists were responsible for the recent attack on some locals in Geidam on October 31, and had planned to meet to review the attack as well as the next line of onslaught on innocent Nigerians and other vulnerable targets.\n",
      "In the south-east, security agencies have sustained incisive operations, rooting out units of IPOB/ESN terrorists from the area. Peace and normalcy are returning, just as citizens’ confidence is witnessing a reinforcement. For instance, On October 5, troops of Operation UDO KA II conducted raids on the haven of the terrorists around Ihiom-Ihittenansa in Orsu Local Government Area and Okigwe-Umulolo in Okigwe Local Government Area of Imo State.\n",
      "The operational base and shrines of the subversives were erased, two suspects arrested, and a cache of arms recovered. This includes ammunition, one PKT machine gun barrel, one locally made rocket-propelled launcher (Ogbunigwe) and IED making materials. In many other operations, imminent attacks had been thwarted, IPOB/ESN terrorists removed and arrested; criminal hermitages destroyed, hostages freed, and arms and ammunition recovered.\n",
      "Further operations are in progress in the north-central, south-south, and south-west. Across these zones, criminal hideouts have been extirpated, threats neutralised, arms and ammunition recovered, suspects arrested, and kidnap victims rescued.\n",
      "These sustained efforts, successes, cooperation, and coordination among the security agencies clearly say there is a responsible, and strategic national security leadership. There is purpose, there is direction; there is commitment, there is the will and the way, and there is a sense of urgency.\n",
      "Securing Nigeria is a principal objective of the Renewed Hope charter. The Tinubu administration has exercised responsibility with significant gains in the sphere of security since assumption of office. Although there is more to be done and will be done, the administration is wholly committed to removing security threats and securing law-abiding Nigerians anywhere in the country.\n",

      "It was gathered that Ikpeha, an indigene of Warri in Delta state was arrested in Imo-Ayo community, Ajibawo Atan Ota in Ado-Odo/Ota local government area of state. \n",
      "The state commander, David Akinremi in a statement said the suspect was arrested following an alarm raised by some members of the community who suspected his movement.\n",
      "He said “When the suspect was searched, three bloodstained wet female pants were found in his possession for which he could not give any satisfactory explanation.\n",
      "“He, (suspect) however claimed to have removed them from dustbins, but insisted he does not know the exact location where he picked them from.”\n",
      "The corps commander explained that Ikpeha was suspected to be working for a syndicate involved in money and other rituals.\n",
      "According to him, the suspect has been transferred to the police for further investigation and possible prosecution.\n",
      "The commander also disclosed that the corps also arrested eight suspected fraudsters for allegedly swindling unsuspected members of the public of the sum of N15million.\n",

      "He explained that the suspects were arrested on Friday, September 30 at their hideout in Idi-Iroko area of Ipokia local government area of the state.\n",
      "According to him, the suspects defrauded their victims on the pretence of online business investment and also facilitating admission for them in a foreign university.\n",

      "2 December 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/12/02/cop28-revisiting-president-tinubus-church-rat-analogy/\n",
      "\n",
      "By Michael Chibuzo\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s attendance at the 10th German-Nigeria Business Forum in Berlin was a pivotal moment witnessing the signing of two groundbreaking Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between Union Bank of Nigeria and DWS Group. These MoUs aim to revolutionize the landscape of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in both Nigeria and Germany.\n",
      "The specifics of the first MoU delineate a pathway for energy export from Nigeria to Germany, utilizing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the European Union – African Union Partnership. This agreement empowers Union Bank of Nigeria to oversee the exportation of solar-generated electricity to Germany via established conduits such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP) and the Trans-Saharan Power Transmission Corridor (TSPTC). In tandem, DWS Group commits technical and financial support, fortifying the development and operation of these solar plants. \n",
      "The second agreement marks a significant investment of $500 million by DWS Group into Nigerian renewable energy projects, mainly focusing on solar initiatives. This is a welcome boost for Nigeria’s economy, as it will create new opportunities for income, employment, and improved access to affordable electricity. It will also help Nigeria diversify its energy mix, reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate its environmental impact. Union Bank of Nigeria and local stakeholders will work together to identify, finance, and implement these projects.\n",
      "These agreements are not only beneficial for Nigeria and Germany, but also for the world at large. They align with both countries’ commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure a sustainable energy future for all. They also reflect the spirit of international collaboration, which is essential for tackling the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the energy transition and climate crisis.\n",
      "President Tinubu deserves praise for his visionary leadership and his unwavering support for these agreements. He has shown that Nigeria is not only a willing partner, but also a leader in renewable energy, particularly solar power. He has also reaffirmed Nigeria’s determination to embrace a sustainable energy future, and to cooperate with other nations in achieving this goal.\n",
      "The signing of these agreements is a milestone in Nigerian-German relations, and a testament to the strength and potential of their partnership. It is also a sign of hope and optimism for the future of renewable energy, and a step towards a brighter, greener future.\n",

      "\n",
      "President Bola Tinubu has made a remarkable achievement for Nigeria’s economic development by securing massive investments from Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful nations. Tinubu met with the Saudi Trade and Investment Minister in Riyadh last week and showed his diplomatic skills in building relationships that go beyond words, focusing on practical results that promise to transform Nigeria’s economic situation.\n",
      "Tinubu’s visionary leadership and strategic intelligence have earned him global respect and admiration. He knows that Nigeria needs to diversify its economy, create jobs, and improve its infrastructure, and he has pursued these goals with steadfast determination and a realistic approach. \n",
      "The multi-billion dollar deals with Saudi Arabia cover crucial sectors such as oil and gas, agriculture, power, and technology. These deals are not only expected to boost Nigeria’s economic foundations but also to encourage innovation and cooperation. Especially noteworthy is Saudi Arabia’s promise to help Nigeria revive its failing refineries, which have suffered from decades of mismanagement, corruption, and inefficiency.\n",
      "The cooperation represents a mutually beneficial partnership where Nigeria can gain from Saudi expertise, capital injection, and wider market access. At the same time, Saudi Arabia can benefit from Nigeria’s potential, resources, and population. Tinubu’s ability to forge such strategic partnerships shows his dedication to advancing Nigeria’s national interests and enhancing its role on the regional and global stage.\n",
      "Tinubu’s victory is a reason for celebration and optimism for all Nigerians, who deserve a better future. As he continues to show transformative leadership, Tinubu has proven himself as the leader Nigeria needs. It is vital for the nation to support him, recognizing the possibility for positive change and progress that his strategic initiatives offer.\n",
      "President Bola Tinubu has taken a major step towards consolidating Nigeria’s economic ties with Saudi Arabia by approving the creation of a business council focused on implementing investments worth billions of dollars. This strategic move follows an initial agreement between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia in 2019, initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. However, the previously established council remained inactive after the agreement was reached.\n",
      "Under Tinubu’s administration, a renewed commitment has been secured with Saudi Arabia to channel investments into key sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, energy (electricity), telecommunications, and technology. This revival in cooperation signifies a proactive effort by Tinubu’s team to activate dormant agreements, creating a climate conducive to economic growth.\n",
      "Moreover, the prospect of additional deals set to materialize before the year ends highlights the effectiveness of Tinubu’s diplomatic efforts. This victory not only stands as a proof of his leadership but also as a significant win for the federal government and Tinubu’s devoted team.\n",
      "The far-reaching impact of these agreements goes beyond diplomatic victories. The injection of investments into sectors like agriculture, oil and gas, energy, telecommunications, and technology promises to be a catalyst for job creation, playing a key role in reducing the problem of unemployment. Additionally, the economic benefits are expected to contribute considerably to increased revenue for the country, aligning with Tinubu’s wider vision for Nigeria’s economic revival.\n",
      "As President Tinubu continues to navigate the intricate landscape of international relations, the active pursuit of agreements and the tangible results achieved underscore his commitment to positioning Nigeria as a global economic player and a hub for innovation and development.\n",

      "\n",
      "Nigeria, a nation teeming with potential and diversity, stands at a pivotal juncture in its history. With a population exceeding 200 million and a GDP surpassing $400 billion, it’s undeniable that Nigeria is a regional powerhouse in Africa. However, the complexities and challenges that have punctuated its bilateral relations with the world have been undeniable, raising questions about the country’s future trajectory.\n",
      "Bilateral relations serve as the lifeblood of a nation’s diplomacy, playing a pivotal role in shaping its economic development, security, and global standing. In the Nigerian context, these relations have not always been smooth, often tainted by conflict and discord with neighboring countries and key trading partners. Yet, President Bola Tinubu, who assumed office in May 2023 following a contentious election, has made it abundantly clear that enhancing Nigeria’s bilateral relations is at the forefront of his agenda. \n",
      "One of President Tinubu’s notable approaches has been an extensive outreach to countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This approach seeks to strengthen existing relationships and uncover new opportunities for trade, investment, and cooperation. High-profile meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been instrumental in fortifying Nigeria’s global connections.\n",
      "Moreover, Nigeria’s participation in various multilateral forums and initiatives underscores its dedication to global peace, security, development, and cooperation. President Tinubu’s leadership within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), co-hosting the Africa Investment Forum, involvement in the G20 Summit, support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), endorsement of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations illustrate the nation’s proactive role in addressing regional and global concerns.\n",
      "The results of these endeavors have been palpable, with Nigeria witnessing substantial improvements in its diplomatic relations, trade and investment, and security. It has also garnered greater respect on the international stage as it plays a constructive role in addressing critical issues. Yet, challenges remain and room for further improvement is evident.\n",
      "To continue this positive trajectory, Nigeria must maintain its pursuit of reforms that enhance governance, economic stability, infrastructure, and human capital. Striking a delicate balance between its interests and values, especially in situations where they diverge, is essential. Diversifying partnerships and engagements, including with less familiar or friendly nations, will further fortify its position.\n",
      "Nigeria’s bilateral relations serve as a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The ultimate objective is to transform Nigeria into a prosperous, secure, democratic, and influential nation. Under President Tinubu’s leadership, the country is taking significant strides toward this goal. In the dynamic world of international relations, Nigeria is firmly positioning itself as the giant of Africa, ready to embrace the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\n",

      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",
      "When the world comes together to take actions on achieving a common goal and proffer collective solutions to a nagging global concern, there are parties involved from government, private sector, civil society, media and multilateral institutions. The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "By Michael Chibuzo\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "29 November 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/11/29/anambra-2025-soludo-headache-multiplies-as-anambra-apc-formally-welcomes-sen-ifeanyi-ubah-and-uche-ekwunife/\n",
      "\n",
      "By Michael Chibuzo \n",
      "On Friday, 2nd December, 2023 Anambra political scene will witness a seismic shift and an informal change of baton following the formal entry of two political heavyweights in Anambra State, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife into the All Progressives Congress fold in what promises to be an era-defining moment. \n",
      "Few weeks ago, the Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Distinguished Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, joined the APC on the floor of the red hallowed chamber. This political move sent shivers down the spine of Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) back home in Anambra State. Soludo immediately placed himself on 2025 campaign mode.\n",
      "Soludo and the APGA hierarchy, who are yet to recover from news of Sen. Ubah’s entry into APC now have the double misfortune to contend with the anticipated entrance of Senator Uche Ekwunife into APC! This has understandably multiplied their headaches. APGA is daily witnessing a resurgent rise of the All Progressives Congress in Anambra State.\n",
      "The entry of the duo of Senator Ubah and Ekwunife will drastically bolster the ranks of the APC in Anambra State and turn it to the party with the most formidable assemblage of the most progressive heavyweight politicians in Anambra. In case APGA still do not understand the shape of the new united Anambra APC that is emerging, it is necessary to briefly remind them.\n",
      "Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife are joining thoroughbred progressives in APC such as the DG, National Planning Commission, Dr. Ben Akabueze, Chief Sylvester Okonkwo (Chief of Staff to the Senate President), Barr. Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye (Women Affairs Minister), Dr. Chioma Ejikeme (Executive Secretary PTAD), Sen. Andy Uba, Dr. Chris Ngige, Dr. George Moghalu, Engr. Azuka Okwuosa, Chief Johnbosco Onunkwo, Sir Paul Chukwuma, Chief Chibuzo Obiakor, Chief Uche Nworah, Sen. Margery Okadigbo, Mrs. Sharon Ikeazor, Chief Kodilichukwu, Sir Ifeanyi Ibezim, and a host of other distinguished individuals too numerous to mention here.\n",
      "Beyond the assemblage of these heavyweight individuals, the APC boasts in its rank and file, the most intelligent and patriotic support base in Anambra State. These are people who understand what governance in a 21st century ought to be. With the newfound unity and determination in place today in Anambra State APC chapter, it is almost impossible for APGA to withstand or resist the tsunamic quest for good governance that the new APC will rally round ndi Anambra to champion henceforth.\n",
      "The Soludo administration is now fully on campaign mode instead of governance judging from the streaks of propaganda flowing out from the state government media machinery. For instance, federal rice palliatives are now being christened *Soludo palliatives* and shared to APGA supporters in 10kg bags branded conspicuously with Soludo and APGA images. This is in stark contrast to what was seen in many other states sizeable palliatives were shared without political undertones.\n",
      "Also the State Governor keeps regurgitating stale and audio promises of tax rebates to low income businesses and artisans anywhere he goes while his aides never fail to package free universal basic education, which has been in place for more than two decades as a phantom achievement of the Governor. Anything hypable is hyped by the Soludo propaganda machinery in an attempt to hoodwink ndi Anambra to believe ‘Solution is here’ and plead for another term for the governor.\n",
      "However ndi Anambra are wiser now, to them, solution is not written on signboards and expensive billboards but on the things they can see and feel. They cannot reinforce failure or subpar performance. As of today, ndi Anambra only see and feel deceit, unfulfilled promises, chaos, confusion in governance and opaqueness as far as the administration of Charles Soludo is concerned. They are ready to change vehicle and driver come 2025.\n",
      "Luckily, the APC is building a brand new modern and progressive political vehicle to ferry ndi Anambra to our desired destination come 2025. The entry of Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife into the party has drastically increased the pace of this process. In 2025, Ndi Anambra will be presented with a competent driver for this alternative new vehicle alongside a smart and highly reliable conductor. With this combination, Anambra’s journey to a truly working modern city state will commence in earnest.\n",

      "In Nigeria, the healthcare system is grappling with a major issue -the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within hospitals. This distressing trend not only threatens the lives and well-being of patients but also undermines the overall credibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system in the country. It is crucial to address this issue urgently, the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within its hospitals. This pervasive problem not only jeopardizes the health and safety of patients but also undermines the credibility and integrity of the healthcare profession as a whole.\n",
      "One of the concerning aspects of this issue is the unfair attribution of gross misconduct to volunteers, despite their significant contributions to the healthcare system, particularly in primary healthcare settings. Volunteers are often the backbone of support when it comes to human resources in these facilities. They selflessly dedicate their time and expertise to assist in delivering much-needed healthcare services to underserved communities. However, due to the actions of a few unscrupulous individuals, volunteers are erroneously held responsible for cases of gross misconduct. \n",
      "It is crucial to recognize that the majority of health or medical supporting staff in private hospitals are quacks or engaged in misconduct. This alarming trend can be attributed in part to the lack of effective regulatory bodies in the country. Inadequate oversight and enforcement mechanisms allow these unqualified individuals to operate freely, putting the lives of innocent patients at risk. Such misconduct ranges from prescribing incorrect medications to performing procedures without proper training and expertise.\n",
      "To address this growing concern, the Nigerian government must take immediate action and implement substantial modalities for volunteers to prevent the proliferation of quackery. These modalities are; \n",
      "-Database and registration (Licensing)\n",
      "-Continuous Professional Development\n",
      "-Training programs and certification courses\n",
      "-Centralized Information System\n",
      "-Monitoring and Evaluation\n",
      "-Investigation and Action\n",
      "-Reporting and Complaint Mechanisms\n",
      "-Collaboration and Information Sharing.\n",
      " Together with robust supervision, should be made mandatory for all volunteers. This will not only equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge but also ensure a higher standard of care for patients.\n",
      "It is imperative to strengthen regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring and disciplining healthcare practitioners. Stricter guidelines and regular inspections should be put in place to identify and eliminate quack practitioners. These bodies should collaborate with relevant stakeholders to improve the overall quality of healthcare services provided in both public and private hospitals.\n",
      "Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate the general population about the dangers of seeking care from unqualified individuals. Emphasizing the importance of verifying the credentials of healthcare providers before seeking their services can help curb the demand for quacks. Encouraging patients to report any cases of misconduct or malpractice they encounter will also aid in identifying and apprehending these illegal practitioners.\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing the burden of quack practitioners and gross misconduct in Nigerian hospitals requires the collective efforts of the government, regulatory bodies, healthcare professionals, and the public. Volunteers should be recognized and supported for their invaluable contributions, while measures should be taken to weed out quack practitioners and strengthen the healthcare system’s regulatory framework. By implementing adequate modalities and promoting a culture of accountability, Nigeria can ensure that its citizens receive reliable and quality healthcare services.\n",

      "“A great leader’s courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not position” \n",
      "– John Maxwell\n",
      "There is a global consensus that universal access to healthcare is an essential human right which is critical to sustainable development. Nigeria is yet to adopt innovative ways to protect the poor and vulnerable populations against financial risk of ill health. It is important to guarantee by law the right to health care of all citizens in Nigeria. Although the National Health Act (NHA) that was signed into law in 2014 states that all Nigerians are entitled to basic minimum package of health care services.\n",
      "Given that “A healthy people is a healthy nation” and considering the poor health infrastructure he inherited from the previous administration, the Governor Yahaya Bello-led administration in Kogi State left no one in doubt about his commitment to reversing the trend. Thus the health sector became his topmost priority and he embarked on a massive revamp of the sector.\n",
      "Some of his interventions include renovation, remodeling and re-equipping of 21 existing Primary Health Care Centres (one per Local Government) with solar-powered boreholes and electrification to help the success of the Healthcare-Plus Programme, a microcosm of the Governor’s State Health Insurance Scheme (SHIS).\n",
      "To further achieve good, quality health services, as well as increase access to services at all levels, all Primary Health Care facilities in the State were put under one roof. The National Health Act. 2014 provides for the operationalisation of Primary Health Care under One Roof (PHCUOR) by States and establishment of Local Government Health Authorities (LGHA) at the Local Government levels as conditions for benefiting from the Basic Health Care Provision Fund.\n",
      "There is no doubting the fact that no sector has received as much attention as the Health sector since Governor Bello came to power. Aside from the completed state-of-the-art Medical Diagnostic Centre in the State that will arguably become the best in the country, lots of other health benefit programmes have been going on, one of which is the Healthcare Plus concept that has been applauded as one chef d’oeuvre intervention scheme across the Federation.\n",
      "Recently, on behalf of Image Merchants Promotion Ltd (IMPR), publishers of PRNigeria, Economic Confidential, Politics Digest and other titles, I was privileged to be part of a media tour of the state meant to unravel all the giant strides of the present administration and to confirm all we have gotten from secondary sources about the governor’s achievements. When we met the Commissioner for Health, Dr Saka Haruna, he was excited about telling us what he and the governor have accomplished in the health sector in the state.\n",
      "He said the Healthcare Plus was an intervention mechanism introduced to help pregnant women and nursing mothers get on with life with less stress and more smile.\n",
      "He described the scheme as one of the best healthcare policies in the country. The programme, he said, makes it possible for pregnant women to have access to medical services across the state and at no cost. With this scheme, child/maternal mortality which was very high prior to 2016, has drastically reduced.\n",
      "He stated that the long term plan of the administration had been to put in place a list of world class Teaching Hospitals, General Hospitals and Reference Hospitals that can rival anyone anywhere in the country as part of measures to stop medical tourism.\n",
      "That took the conversation to the gigantic Reference Hospital the governor is building in Okene which is said to be one of the best in the country.\n",
      "“Many of the equipment that will be deployed at the hospital are already available, like the Hyperbaric oxygen treatment chamber which is debuting Nigeria for the first time, fully furnished cardiology suites where investigative and interventional therapy will be carried out, are also available. A diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that has an AP lab and a Cat lab are all coming into the country for the first time,” the Commissioner said.\n",
      "The Commissioner encouraged us to visit the Hospital and see things for ourselves. He assured us if we take the pain to go there we wont regret the adventure.\n",
      "On getting to Okene where the Hospital is located, we were not disappointed. What we saw was an imposing 300-bed capacity Hospital which was at an advanced stage of construction and which is expected to be completed in August this year.\n",
      "A world class Reference Hospital for the treatment of advanced medical conditions that have been forcing Kogites and Nigerians to go abroad in search of succour, it has Female Wards Male Wards, Emergency Wards, Surgical Wards, Medical Wards, VIP Ward, VVIP Wards, all of which are ten each in number. It also has a Ward for Renal ailments and another one for Dental issues. It has two different Laboratories (Hematology Lab and Histopathology Lab).\n",

      "President TeamNigera4Change, Bestman Jumbo-Nze has described findings of opinion poll conducted by Best Media Consultants as the true reflection of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s performance in Lagos. \n",
      "Best man Jumbo-Nze noted that the verdict of Sanwolu as the best governor using the criteria underscored the position of Lagos residents about their governor.\n",
      "He said the work the governor has done in the state is devoid of the usual media hype which underscores the humility attribute of Sanwo-olu\n",

      "Sanwo-Olu  emerged as the overall best governor in handling of Covid 19 pandemic, security, infrastructure, economy, political sagacity, humility and environment/waste management in report published by the research group last week.\n",
      "According to the report, Governor Wike of Rivers state emerged second for management of environment/waste and Covid 19.\n",
      "A statement by Best Media Consultants said the research was conducted in its quest to deepen Nigeria’s democracy and to feel the pulse of Nigerians on governance in four major commercial cities in Nigeria, namely Lagos, Abia, Kano and Rivers states.\n",
      "The group said it deployed the face-to-face interviewing technique through the use of a structured questionnaire in conducting the research.\n",
      "“Our audience have travelled to the four commercial cities not less than five (5) times in the last 24 months. They read, listen and watch core media platforms often. They were drawn from the ABC, socio economic class, they cut across both sex (male and female).All respondents were screened to eliminate political bias, interest, loyalty and sympathy. They were all non-partisan.Timing: Research study was conducted in June/July 2021\n",
      "According to the findings “With a mean score of +4.41(96%) our audience tended to believe Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu have handled Covid 19 Pandemic better than others. Governor Wike was rated +3.44 (77%).\n",
      "“Security no doubt have become a major challenge across the country, Governor Babajide was rated +3.32, on handling of security challenges in Lagos. This call for more efforts, when compared to others, he has done better than Governor Wike who was rated +2.42\n",

      "“With a mean score of +3.84, Governor Wike was rated to have done more in infrastructure followed by Governor Ganduje with +3.64, while Governor Babajide was rated +3.43.

      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/11/25/opinion-a-new-era-of-defence-industrialization-in-nigeria/\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria, a nation grappling with security challenges from terrorism to banditry, is in dire need of a formidable defence force. This force, however, is only as strong as the equipment and technology it employs. For too long, Nigeria has leaned on foreign sources for its defence needs, a dependence that has left it vulnerable to supply disruptions, price fluctuations, and quality issues.\n",
      "Our reliance on foreign sources has also stunted our ability to develop our own defence capabilities and innovations, crucial for addressing our unique security challenges. It is in this context that the recent assent of President Bola Tinubu to the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) Bill, 2023, sponsored by Hon. Babajimi Benson, should be seen as a game-changer. \n",
      "Established in 1964, DICON was designed to be the backbone of Nigeria’s defence industry. Unfortunately, due to underfunding, mismanagement, and obsolescence, its productivity and quality have dwindled. The new bill aims to revitalize DICON by giving it the power to operate and control subsidiaries and ordnance factories, establish the Defence Industry Technology, Research, and Development Institute (DITRDI), provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for the defence sector, and incentivize private capital in the defence sector.\n",
      "The potential for this bill to transform Nigeria’s defence industry is profound. It promises a vibrant and competitive sector that can meet the needs of our armed forces and contribute to our national economy. By bolstering DICON’s capacity and autonomy, the bill can help Nigeria reduce its dependence on foreign sources, save foreign exchange, create jobs, and foster innovation.\n",
      "The bill also promotes collaboration and synergy among various stakeholders in the defence sector, including the private sector and academia, stimulating growth in related industries and sectors.\n",
      "While the assent of the bill is a commendable step, it is not the end of the journey. Its implementation will require the commitment and support of the government, the military, the private sector, and the public.\n",
      "The government must ensure adequate funding and oversight for DICON and its subsidiaries, and provide the necessary legal and policy frameworks for its operations. The military must patronize and partner with DICON, providing feedback and guidance on their products and services. The private sector must invest and participate in the defence industry while adhering to ethical and professional standards. The public must support and appreciate DICON’s efforts, demanding accountability and transparency.\n",
      "Nigeria’s vision to become one of the top 20 economies in the world by 2030 hinges on a robust defence industry that can guarantee its security and prosperity. The Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria Bill, 2023, is a step in the right direction, marking the beginning of a new era of defence industrialization in Nigeria.\n",

      "The Burden of Quack Practitioners and Gross Misconduct in Nigerian Hospitals\n",
      "6 November 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/11/06/the-burden-of-quack-practitioners-and-gross-misconduct-in-nigerian-hospitals/\n",
      "\n",
      "In Nigeria, the healthcare system is grappling with a major issue -the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within hospitals. This distressing trend not only threatens the lives and well-being of patients but also undermines the overall credibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system in the country. It is crucial to address this issue urgently, the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within its hospitals. This pervasive problem not only jeopardizes the health and safety of patients but also undermines the credibility and integrity of the healthcare profession as a whole.\n",
      "One of the concerning aspects of this issue is the unfair attribution of gross misconduct to volunteers, despite their significant contributions to the healthcare system, particularly in primary healthcare settings. Volunteers are often the backbone of support when it comes to human resources in these facilities. They selflessly dedicate their time and expertise to assist in delivering much-needed healthcare services to underserved communities. However, due to the actions of a few unscrupulous individuals, volunteers are erroneously held responsible for cases of gross misconduct. \n",
      "It is crucial to recognize that the majority of health or medical supporting staff in private hospitals are quacks or engaged in misconduct. This alarming trend can be attributed in part to the lack of effective regulatory bodies in the country. Inadequate oversight and enforcement mechanisms allow these unqualified individuals to operate freely, putting the lives of innocent patients at risk. Such misconduct ranges from prescribing incorrect medications to performing procedures without proper training and expertise.\n",
      "To address this growing concern, the Nigerian government must take immediate action and implement substantial modalities for volunteers to prevent the proliferation of quackery. These modalities are; \n",
      "-Database and registration (Licensing)\n",
      "-Continuous Professional Development\n",
      "-Training programs and certification courses\n",
      "-Centralized Information System\n",
      "-Monitoring and Evaluation\n",
      "-Investigation and Action\n",
      "-Reporting and Complaint Mechanisms\n",
      "-Collaboration and Information Sharing.\n",
      " Together with robust supervision, should be made mandatory for all volunteers. This will not only equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge but also ensure a higher standard of care for patients.\n",
      "It is imperative to strengthen regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring and disciplining healthcare practitioners. Stricter guidelines and regular inspections should be put in place to identify and eliminate quack practitioners. These bodies should collaborate with relevant stakeholders to improve the overall quality of healthcare services provided in both public and private hospitals.\n",
      "Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate the general population about the dangers of seeking care from unqualified individuals. Emphasizing the importance of verifying the credentials of healthcare providers before seeking their services can help curb the demand for quacks. Encouraging patients to report any cases of misconduct or malpractice they encounter will also aid in identifying and apprehending these illegal practitioners.\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing the burden of quack practitioners and gross misconduct in Nigerian hospitals requires the collective efforts of the government, regulatory bodies, healthcare professionals, and the public. Volunteers should be recognized and supported for their invaluable contributions, while measures should be taken to weed out quack practitioners and strengthen the healthcare system’s regulatory framework. By implementing adequate modalities and promoting a culture of accountability, Nigeria can ensure that its citizens receive reliable and quality healthcare services.\n",

      "Nigeria is a nation on the move. A nation that is embracing the power of technology to reshape its destiny. A nation that is witnessing a digital revolution that is transforming every aspect of its society. A nation that is being led by a visionary leader who understands the importance of technology for the future of Nigeria.\n",
      "That leader is President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who took office in 2023 with a clear mandate to accelerate Nigeria’s digital transformation. Since then, he has implemented a series of policies and programs that have enhanced the digital landscape in Nigeria, creating a conducive environment for innovation, growth, and inclusion. In this opinion column, I will highlight some of the key initiatives undertaken by the Tinubu Administration in four critical sectors: fintech, agriculture, education, and technology. \n",
      "Fintech: The Financial Sector’s Game-Changer\n",
      "One of the most visible impacts of digital transformation in Nigeria can be seen in the financial sector. Fintech companies have emerged as the game-changers, offering innovative financial services to the unbanked and underbanked population. Mobile banking, digital payment solutions, and peer-to-peer lending platforms have fundamentally changed how Nigerians manage their finances. This digital revolution has not only boosted financial inclusion but has also contributed to economic growth and poverty reduction.\n",
      "President Tinubu has shown a strong support for the fintech sector, recognizing its potential to drive Nigeria’s development. He has introduced policies that foster collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups, creating a win-win situation for both parties. He has also established regulatory sandboxes that allow fintech companies to test their products and services in a controlled environment, without compromising the security and efficiency of financial transactions. Moreover, he has promoted the use of digital identity systems, such as the National Identification Number (NIN), to facilitate the verification and authentication of customers and transactions.\n",
      "Agriculture: Cultivating Growth through Technology\n",
      "Agriculture, the backbone of Nigeria’s economy, has also undergone a remarkable transformation through technology. From precision farming to e-commerce platforms linking farmers with buyers, technology has brought efficiency and transparency to the sector. Access to real-time weather information, mobile apps for crop management, and digital marketplaces have empowered farmers, increasing productivity and food security.\n",
      "President Tinubu has demonstrated a keen interest in improving the agricultural sector through technology. He has partnered with technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to provide farmers with access to digital tools and techniques that can enhance their farming practices. He has also invested in rural broadband infrastructure, ensuring that even remote areas have access to the benefits of digital agriculture. Furthermore, he has launched initiatives, such as the Green Imperative Program, to provide farmers with mechanization and irrigation facilities, as well as training and extension services.\n",
      "Education: Bridging the Knowledge Gap\n",
      "Digital transformation has also revolutionized Nigeria’s education sector, bridging the knowledge gap and providing access to quality education for all. E-learning platforms, online courses, and virtual classrooms have made education more accessible, especially for those in remote areas. Technology has created new opportunities for lifelong learning, skill development, and professional growth.\n",
      "President Tinubu has placed a strong emphasis on enhancing digital education in Nigeria. He has worked with educational technology providers, such as Coursera and Udemy, to equip schools with the necessary digital infrastructure and resources. He has also initiated programs, such as the Digital Literacy and Skills Program, to train teachers in digital pedagogy and develop digital content for the curriculum. Additionally, he has supported the establishment of innovation hubs and centers of excellence, such as the African University of Science and Technology, to foster research and development in science and technology.\n",
      "Technology: Building a Digital Workforce\n",
      "Technology, as a sector in itself, has witnessed tremendous growth and development in Nigeria. The country has become a hub of innovation, producing world-class tech startups and solutions. From e-commerce to ride-hailing, social media to gaming, Nigerian tech entrepreneurs have made their mark on the global stage. Technology has also created new employment opportunities, especially for the youth, who constitute the majority of the population.\n",
      "President Tinubu has shown a strong commitment to supporting and enhancing the tech sector in Nigeria. One of his flagship initiatives is the 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) program, which aims to train and place 3 million Nigerians in technical skills, such as software development, data science, cybersecurity, and cloud computing by 2025. The program, executed in collaboration with NITDA, will generate a pipeline of technical talent that will power Nigeria’s digital economy and position the country as a net talent exporter. President Tinubu has also introduced other policies and programs to foster the tech sector, such as streamlining regulatory processes, investing in digital infrastructure, promoting digital skills and education, and fostering collaborations with international partners .\n",
      "Nigeria is a nation that is undergoing a digital transformation that is reshaping its future. A nation that is being led by a leader who has a vision and a plan to make Nigeria a digital powerhouse. A nation that is poised to become a role model for other African countries and the world. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the leader that Nigeria needs to achieve its digital aspirations. He is the leader that is leading Nigeria’s digital transformation.\n",

This was contained in a press statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga. \n",
      "According to the presidential Adviser, President Bola Tinubu’s administration respects the views of Nigerians on all matters of public concern and therefore considers it very imperative to clear any misconception and misunderstanding of the issues.\n",
      "Bayo Onanuga stated that what was named as Presidential Yacht in the budget is an Operational Naval boat with specialized security gadgets suitable for high profile operational inspection and not for the use of the President.\n",
      "“The naval boat is designated a “presidential yacht” by way of nomenclature because of the high level security features”, he stated. \n",
      "Bayo Onanuga also revealed that the said Naval boat was ordered by the navy under the previous administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and President Tinubu in line with his belief that government is a continuum and having inherited both assets and liabilities of past administrations decided to conclude the acquisition.\n",
      "Mr. Onanuga also stated that the payment request for the boat was part of the committed obligation submitted by the office of the Chief of Naval Staff to the Ministry of Defence. The total of the submitted requests according to him was in excess of N200 billion out which N62 billion was approved by the President.\n",
      "“President Tinubu is focused on securing our country and territorial waters. The Federal Government under his leadership is investing more resources to enhance greater economic output from our oil and gas, marine and blue economy”, Onanuga continued.\n",
      "“In President Tinubu, we have a leader who understands the economic challenges being faced by the masses. His administration is working very hard to confront and surmount those challenges.

      "Emotions are funny. They propel us and they hold us back. They polarize us and they unite us. They confuse us and they make things crystal clear.\n",
      "Many believe the best performers are those devoid of emotion, but I think they just understand what emotion to indulge in given the task at hand. Nigerians are very emotional. We are passionate about sports, family, politics and so on. \n",
      "This passion has seen us support causes and ventures closely and with great intensity. However, because most do not support their passions with adequate information and understanding of the larger vision, being easily discouraged is sadly one of our enduring traits. Unfortunately, endurance is a key trait we need to get Nigeria through its current predicament and to the Promise Land.\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29th, 2023. According to an online calculator, that day was 22,885 days since the British gave Nigeria her independence on October 1st, 1960, and 8,766 days since the return to democracy on May 29th, 1999. He is yet to clock 85 days in office as at the time I am typing this article but there are certain people who want you to believe he has failed already.\n",
      "Yes, opinions are free but what makes it particularly dangerous for such thoughts to be left unanswered is the fact that there are certain elements in our society that are ready to use any excuse to foment disharmony. We must give our people any understanding of what the President has been doing since he took office and the immediate, mid- and long-term consequences of his actions.\n",
      "If a patient presents with Multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of 2 or more long-term health conditions), the best way for a doctor to move forward is to understand the issues, acknowledge the challenges and communicate to the patient the uncertainty of the net benefits of the multiple medications and procedures that will have to be done.\n",
      "In cases like this, there is not one best solution because while one medication might be curing one illness, it might be exasperating another. The doctors and the patient must agree on the road map to good health, knowing that there will be painful lows and sweet highs in the undulating path to success. For instance, the loss of hair during chemotherapy should never come to the patient as either a surprise or a sign of further failing health but should be expected as a sign that work is ongoing. Communication is vital.\n",
      "The long analogy above can be used to describe where President Tinubu and Nigeria find themselves today. The path to economic prosperity, unity and peace was always going to be painful and arduous. There is no magic to success. And, on his part, “Doctor” (President) Tinubu has told the nation just how “sick” (economically crippled) his “patient” (Nigeria) is.\n",
      "Below is a portion of the speech the President gave on July 31st, 2023, 63 days after he took office:\n",
      "“Our economy is going through a tough patch and you are being hurt by it. The cost of fuel has gone up. Food and other prices have followed it. Households and businesses struggle. Things seem anxious and uncertain. I understand the hardship you face. I wish there were other ways. But there is not. If there were, I would have taken that route as I came here to help not hurt the people and nation that I love.”\n",
      "This President understands what the everyday Nigerian is going through. That is why he ran for office. On July 6th, the President signed four different Executive Orders. They included the one that suspends the 2023 Finance Act deferring the date of its commencement from May 28, 2023 to September 1,2023, the Customs Excise Tariffs Amendment Order 2023, as well as the imposition of 5% Excise Tax on Telecommunication Services, amongst others. This was done to create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive by reducing the existence of multiple taxes.\n",
      "On August 8th, President Tinubu inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms. The committee was set up four weeks prior and is chaired by former Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), Taiwo Oyedele.\n",
      "The committee has experts from both the private and public sectors as members. While directing all government MDAs to give the committee their maximum cooperation, the President said, “Within the scope of this mandate, the Committee shall have as its objective the advancement of viable and cost effective solutions to issues such as the multiplicity of revenue collection agencies, the high cost of revenue administration, the excessive burden of compliance on ordinary taxpayers, the lack of effective coordination between fiscal and other economic policies within and across levels of government and poor accountability in the utilisation of tax revenues.\n",
      "“Our target is to improve Nigeria’s revenue profile while making the business environment more conducive and internationally competitive. Our aim is to transform the tax system to support sustainable development, while, at the same time, achieving a minimum of 18% Tax to GDP ratio within the next three years.”\n",

      "The commissioner expressed her disappointment with the promoters of the film, Jade Osiberu and Kemi Akindoju, for portraying the Eyo Masquerade as a gun-wielding villain while adorning the full traditional regalia.\n",
      "The Eyo Festival is rarely observed and only comes up as a traditional rite of passage for Obas, revered Chiefs and eminent Lagos Indigenes while the Eyo Madquerade is used as a symbol of honour for such personalities and remarkable historical events.\n",

      "“It is an unjust profiling of a people and culture as being barbaric and nefarious. It depicts a gang of murderers rampaging across the State”.\n",

      "He said, “There is a film presently being promoted by one Jade Osiberu and another character called Kemi Akindoju. The so called movie is an ugly, hate filled mockery of the Lagosian heritage.\n",
      "“In their reckless, disgusting distortion of the sacred illustration of the Lagosian culture the film makers reduced the Eyo masquerade into a gun toting killing machine, clothing their misfit actors in the full regalia of the Eyo and with the Aga depicting some Conclaves.\n",
      "“This is a total abomination. It is not only a distortion of our culture, it is a dark insidious profiling of our people as criminals and murderers rampaging across Lagos.\n",
      "“The Adamu Orisha is a treasured cleansing ritual, a sacred rite performed on the passage of an Oba or for their coronation.\n",
      "“It is also used to honor distinguished Lagosians as their final rite of transition.\n",
      "“Since Ejilu and Malakin, the brothers of Olori Olugbani first initiated the Eyo rite in celebration of Oba Ado Keme, the Adamu Orisha has become a sacred ancestral heritage celebrated with awe and deserving adoration.\n",

      "18 September 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/09/18/exposed-real-reasons-some-senators-are-plotting-akpabios-ouster/\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh details on the agitation against President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio emerged over the weekend with the revelation that the disaffection on committee appointments was only diversionary.\n",
      "The real angst of the group of senators, it was reliably gathered, is the suspicion of the incapacity of the Senate President to checkmate what some northern senators are calling the Yorubanisation of the country’s financial system and economy. \n",
      "Besides the alleged perception of Akpabio’s lack of capacity to checkmate the purported domination of the Yoruba ethnic nationalities in the financial ecosystem, is also his alleged refusal to deal with some powerful interest groups, particularly some petrol importers and the electricity distribution companies on some proposed financial deals bordering on 40 percent electricity tariff hike and payment of outstanding money to fuel importers.\n",
      "Newspaper publications had last weekend alleged a plot by some unnamed senators against Akpabio alleging lopsided distribution of Grade A committees mainly in favour of his supporters and to the discrimination of those who opposed him during the leadership contest.\n",
      "While it was gathered that the allegation may have some substance, it has, however, emerged that some rivals of the Senate President may have regrouped using as a reason, his apparent failure to check the lopsided appointments by the President in favour of the Yoruba, especially in the financial sector.\n",
      "Among the senators, who are alleged to have regrouped with a mission of standing up to Senator Akpabio are some former governors drawn from the North and at least one from the South-South.\n",
      "The group has now formally come out by presenting Senator Elisha Abbo, APC, Adamawa North as the face of the group.\n",
      "Senator Abbo, in newspaper interviews at the weekend, accused Akpabio of marginalising his rivals in the leadership contest and their supporters in the distribution of the committee positions.\n",
      "However, sources within the Abbo group have now revealed that the angst of the group was far more and go beyond the Senate President.\n",
      "“The main issue is our fear that Akpabio cannot check this Yorubanisation of the financial system that is going on now,” a source within the group revealed at the weekend.\n",
      "The source who spoke on the basis of confidentiality alluded to the appointments at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Customs, among others that have recently been infused with Yoruba leadership. The control of the agencies is besides the appointment of Yoruba Ministers in the financial sector and the blue economy.\n",
      "“Yes, the reason why you can see that Northerners are mostly involved is that most of those being removed and replaced with Yoruba are northerners,” the source further revealed.\n",
      "It was further gathered that the aim of the senators is to enthrone a senate president the group believes can checkmate President Bola Tinubu.\n",
      "Besides the appointments, the group is also said to be working on behalf of some interest groups in the economy who believe that they were shortchanged after reaching agreements with the president and Akpabio on the payment of subsidy to the petrol importers.\n",
      "It was gathered that an arrangement had been reached with the presidency that funds generated from the removal of fuel subsidy would be used to settle petrol importers within the first two months of the removal of subsidy. The fund amounting to N2 trillion has, however, not been so used but rather pushed to palliatives intervention.\n",
      "Another interest group said to have infiltrated the ranks of the dissident senators were some Electricity Distribution companies who were said to have also reached an agreement with the presidency and Akpabio for an upward review of 40 percent of tariff. That agreement was, however, discountenanced on the Senate floor by Akpabio.\n",
      "Just like those being pushed out in the appointments in the financial sector, Northern business interest groups, are believed to be more affected by the decision not to pay the petrol importers.\n",

      "Emotions are funny. They propel us and they hold us back. They polarize us and they unite us. They confuse us and they make things crystal clear.\n",
      "Many believe the best performers are those devoid of emotion, but I think they just understand what emotion to indulge in given the task at hand. Nigerians are very emotional. We are passionate about sports, family, politics and so on. \n",
      "This passion has seen us support causes and ventures closely and with great intensity. However, because most do not support their passions with adequate information and understanding of the larger vision, being easily discouraged is sadly one of our enduring traits. Unfortunately, endurance is a key trait we need to get Nigeria through its current predicament and to the Promise Land.\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29th, 2023. According to an online calculator, that day was 22,885 days since the British gave Nigeria her independence on October 1st, 1960, and 8,766 days since the return to democracy on May 29th, 1999. He is yet to clock 85 days in office as at the time I am typing this article but there are certain people who want you to believe he has failed already.\n",
      "Yes, opinions are free but what makes it particularly dangerous for such thoughts to be left unanswered is the fact that there are certain elements in our society that are ready to use any excuse to foment disharmony. We must give our people any understanding of what the President has been doing since he took office and the immediate, mid- and long-term consequences of his actions.\n",
      "If a patient presents with Multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of 2 or more long-term health conditions), the best way for a doctor to move forward is to understand the issues, acknowledge the challenges and communicate to the patient the uncertainty of the net benefits of the multiple medications and procedures that will have to be done.\n",
      "In cases like this, there is not one best solution because while one medication might be curing one illness, it might be exasperating another. The doctors and the patient must agree on the road map to good health, knowing that there will be painful lows and sweet highs in the undulating path to success. For instance, the loss of hair during chemotherapy should never come to the patient as either a surprise or a sign of further failing health but should be expected as a sign that work is ongoing. Communication is vital.\n",
      "The long analogy above can be used to describe where President Tinubu and Nigeria find themselves today. The path to economic prosperity, unity and peace was always going to be painful and arduous. There is no magic to success. And, on his part, “Doctor” (President) Tinubu has told the nation just how “sick” (economically crippled) his “patient” (Nigeria) is.\n",
      "Below is a portion of the speech the President gave on July 31st, 2023, 63 days after he took office:\n",
      "“Our economy is going through a tough patch and you are being hurt by it. The cost of fuel has gone up. Food and other prices have followed it. Households and businesses struggle. Things seem anxious and uncertain. I understand the hardship you face. I wish there were other ways. But there is not. If there were, I would have taken that route as I came here to help not hurt the people and nation that I love.”\n",
      "This President understands what the everyday Nigerian is going through. That is why he ran for office. On July 6th, the President signed four different Executive Orders. They included the one that suspends the 2023 Finance Act deferring the date of its commencement from May 28, 2023 to September 1,2023, the Customs Excise Tariffs Amendment Order 2023, as well as the imposition of 5% Excise Tax on Telecommunication Services, amongst others. This was done to create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive by reducing the existence of multiple taxes.\n",
      "On August 8th, President Tinubu inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms. The committee was set up four weeks prior and is chaired by former Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), Taiwo Oyedele.\n",
      "The committee has experts from both the private and public sectors as members. While directing all government MDAs to give the committee their maximum cooperation, the President said, “Within the scope of this mandate, the Committee shall have as its objective the advancement of viable and cost effective solutions to issues such as the multiplicity of revenue collection agencies, the high cost of revenue administration, the excessive burden of compliance on ordinary taxpayers, the lack of effective coordination between fiscal and other economic policies within and across levels of government and poor accountability in the utilisation of tax revenues.\n",
      "“Our target is to improve Nigeria’s revenue profile while making the business environment more conducive and internationally competitive. Our aim is to transform the tax system to support sustainable development, while, at the same time, achieving a minimum of 18% Tax to GDP ratio within the next three years.”\n",
      "Currently, Nigeria has a 10.86% Tax to GDP ratio making it one of the countries with the lowest tax collection rates in the world. Seeking to grow this by 80% in 3 years is a sign that the President is bullish about Nigeria and deserves support and commendation.\n",
      "Strengthening the manufacturing sector is vital if our economic and job creation goals must be met. To achieve this, President Tinubu has announced that, between July 2023 and March 2024, 75 enterprises “with great potential to kick-start a sustainable economic growth” will be selected and supported with N1 Billion credit at 9% per annum with maximum of 60 months repayment for long term loans and 12 months for working capital.\n",
      "Also, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector will be energized with N125 billion within the same time frame.\n",
      "On August 17th, it was announced that the Federal Government had approved N5 billion for each state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to enable them to procure food items for distribution to the poor in their respective states. This was in addition to the delivery of five trucks of grains to each state to support the drive to moderate prices. The government is also planning to provide are also providing 225,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer, seedlings and other inputs to farmers all to ensure food security.\n",
      "He has made swift changes to those in charge of our fiscal and monetary policies, and removed the inefficient fuel subsidy that has forced the country into great debt. In July, the three tiers of government had N1.959 trillion to share. This is nearly triple the N786.161 billion shared in June and more than triple the N655.93 billion in May. The Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) had adopted N436.38 per dollar as exchange rate for the calculation of the forex component of collected revenues for June 2023 and that had gone up to about N750 per dollar at the time.\n",
      "Only N907 billion was distributed among the three tiers of government, while N790 billion was saved, and the rest used for statutory deductions.\n",
      "The President also approved the Infrastructure Support Fund for the States. This is designed to enable the States “to intervene and invest in the critical areas of Transportation, including farm-to-market road improvements; Agriculture, encompassing livestock and ranching solutions; Health, with a focus on basic healthcare; Education, especially basic education; Power and Water Resources, that will improve economic competitiveness, create jobs and deliver economic prosperity for Nigerians.”\n",
      "These are all happening as the President has spent the first 100 days of his administration redefining democracy and demystifying the Presidency. So far, he has received visits from various ethnic groups, many of them minorities that have special requests. He has engaged with various sectors vital to the socio-economic stability of the country. Our war on insecurity has taken a refreshing approach as the new service chiefs have gotten their marching orders.\n",
      "The state governors are in talks with the Organised Labour on the new minimum wage, even as each one of them has been given N5 billion and five trucks of grains to help alleviate the pains brought on by the removal of fuel subsidy.\n",
      "Scarcity is the mother of innovation, hence there is now a realization that we can use alternative fuels to power our economy. To this end, the President approved the establishment of the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas Initiative (PCNGI). The move is poised to revolutionise the transportation landscape in the country, targeting over 11,500 new Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-enabled vehicles and 55,000 CNG conversion kits for existing Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)-dependent vehicles. The initiative comprises of a Comprehensive Adoption Strategy, to include Empowering Workshops Programme, Local Assembly and Job Creation.\n",
      "To also prepare Nigeria for the economy of today and the future, 10 new ministries have been created or others modified to ensure optimum delivery of service to the people. They include: Marine and Blue Economy; Art, Culture and the Creative Economy; Health and Social Welfare; Aviation and Aerospace Development amongst others.\n",
      "The road to economic recovery is an intricate process that demands careful consideration and collaboration. President Tinubu recognizes this and has reiterated the need for a collective effort in overcoming the challenges faced by Nigeria.\n",
      "While painful adjustments may be necessary, the long-term gains must be prioritized. Investing in infrastructure, diversifying the economy, and promoting job creation are among the strategies to foster growth and stabilize the nation’s financial health.\n",
      "Emotions have a profound impact on our lives, and in Nigeria, they hold significant sway over our actions and beliefs. Developing a balanced approach that combines our passionate nature with informed understanding is key to overcoming challenges.\n",
      "President Tinubu’s tenure may be in its early stages, but it is essential to avoid premature judgments and give due time for effective policies to take root. Communication, empathy, and endurance are crucial elements as Nigeria navigates its path to a promising future. By embracing these factors and engaging in constructive dialogue, we can build a prosperous and united nation.\n",

      "By Temitope Ajayi\n",
      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",
      "When the world comes together to take actions on achieving a common goal and proffer collective solutions to a nagging global concern, there are parties involved from government, private sector, civil society, media and multilateral institutions. The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "By Michael Chibuzo\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "Olusegun Dada, a strong pillar of the APC Youth Wing and celebrated media strategist, has received an award from the National Association of University Students as an icon of youth development. This took place on Tuesday, May 30, at the inauguration after-party staged by the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (ABAT) Media Centre. It was graced by a broad coalition of the party’s youth arm and its support groups from across the country.\n",
      "According to the leadership of the student body, Olusegun Dada was honoured with the award owing to his long contributions to the development of young people in the country, notably through meaningful empowerment, fair representation and the advancement of causes focused on providing young people with a conducive learning and living experience, on and off campus. \n",
      "The group traced Dada’s university years as an activist who sacrificed his time and resources in defense of student’s rights and equitable access to gainful opportunities, a mission they claimed he has continued as a mainstream politician and which was responsible for his broad national acceptance as a credible representative of young people.\n",
      "The honour came amid reports of Dada’s appointment as a Special Assistant on Digital Media to Nigeria’s newly sworn-in president, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. His elevation is said to be informed by his excellent contributions to the defense and promotion of the president during the campaign through the design and execution of effective media strategies.\n",
      "Indeed, Olusegun Dada is widely credited to have been instrumental in neutralizing the disinformation campaign targeted at the president by his opponents ever since he declared his intention to run for office. News of his appointment has been trailed by widespread jubilation, with many affirming his fitness for the role.\n",
      "In his speech at the event, Dada thanked all in attendance for their support and encouragement, while also pledging to never relent in his promotion of youth interests. He urged unity as the country transitions from election to governance, noting that as winners, party members must be willing to be the ‘bigger person’ and extend an olive branch to their counterparts who took a different stance but are equally desirous of a better Nigeria.\n",
      "He specially thanked Seyi Tinubu, the nation’s first son, for his faith in him and generosity which, according to him, further endeared more young Nigerians to the president. He was also thankful to the DG of ABAT Media Centre, Adebola Ademuyiwa, and other leaders of the party present such as Ayobami Oyalowo and Tolu Ogunlesi for their roles in the triumph of the party at the polls.\n",

      "28 May 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/05/28/aregbesola-champions-easier-path-to-naturalisation-announces-brown-card-for-permanent-residency/\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign nationals with exceptional talent or those of African descent that wish to make Nigeria their home and those who desire to invest in Nigeria now can become Nigerians through a legal instrument called “The Brown Card.” This was announced by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, on Saturday, 27th May 2023 in Abuja during a ceremony to confer Nigerian Citizenship on 385 deserving adult foreign nationals from different countries.\n",
      " \n",
      "At the event, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister explained that although the Buhari administration approved the highest number of naturalised citizens in the country’s history, he was unhappy with the number and sought alternative paths for deserving foreigners to gain the right to become Nigerians. Ogbeni Aregbesola was emphatic that having smoother paths to citizenship for worthy foreigners is a great way to make Nigeria prosperous. \n",
      "In his words, “One of the objectives of this administration is to lay a solid socio-economic and political foundation that will elevate Nigeria into one of the 20 great economies of the world. To achieve this global vision, the government is determined to encourage and attract foreigners – investors, resourceful individuals and people with rare talents and unbounded energy – into the country.\n",
      "“Under our administration, the largest number of foreigners have been naturalised. Between 2011 and 2013, a total of 266 foreigners became Nigerians. In 2017, 335 people took up Nigerian citizenship. But last year, 286 foreigners and today at this ceremony, 385, making a total of 1006 have acquired Nigerian citizenship.\n",
      "“I am still not pleased with this figure. In Europe and America, thousands of foreigners are inducted into citizenship every year. They do this to attract youths and people in their prime who would like to contribute to the development of their countries. Let’s face it. There is a limit to your expectations from a non-citizen and it is reasonable to expect an average person to be more loyal to his or her country.\n",
      "“The bane of the smooth pathway to Nigerian citizenship however is the constitutional requirement of continuous residency in Nigeria for 15 years. This is a huge disincentive, considering that in the United States and most European countries, it is five years. Some of these countries have made a habit of snatching young and resourceful brains, through easy pathways, to obtain quality migration to their countries.\n",
      "“I will therefore urge the relevant institutions of state to reconsider this in the next effort at amendment to the constitution. We ought to have easier pathways to citizenship for foreigners than currently obtains.”\n",
      "The Minister also said it was imperative for Nigeria to make it easy for foreigner husbands of Nigerian women to gain citizenship. He also explained what led to the emergence of the Brown Card.\n",
      "“My Ministry sought and got the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council, to execute new pathways to permanent residency for eligible foreign nationals. I am happy therefore to announce the Brown Card, as the legal instrument to Permanent Residency.\n",
      "“The Minister of Interior is now invested with the authority to confer Permanent Residency on non-Nigerian persons, enabling such beneficiaries to live and work in Nigeria without the requirement of renewal every five years, as was the case.”\n",
      "Ogbeni Aregbesola said those who are qualified for this new instrument of Permanent Residency are as follows:\n",
      "1. Foreign nationals of African descent who desire to make Nigeria their homeland through the ‘Privilege of Return’\n",
      "2. Foreign nationals who desire to invest in Nigeria in line with established guidelines\n",
      "3. Foreign nationals who had demonstrated exceptional talents, knowledge and skills in rare fields of Science, Technology, Medicine, Engineering, the Arts, Sports and other areas as might be determined from time to time.\n",
      "4. Male foreign nationals married to Nigerian women for a minimum period of one year.\n",
      "The specific details for application and processing will be announced later by the Ministry of Interior and Nigeria Immigration Service.\n",

      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s attendance at the 10th German-Nigeria Business Forum in Berlin was a pivotal moment witnessing the signing of two groundbreaking Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between Union Bank of Nigeria and DWS Group. These MoUs aim to revolutionize the landscape of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in both Nigeria and Germany.\n",
      "The specifics of the first MoU delineate a pathway for energy export from Nigeria to Germany, utilizing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the European Union – African Union Partnership. This agreement empowers Union Bank of Nigeria to oversee the exportation of solar-generated electricity to Germany via established conduits such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP) and the Trans-Saharan Power Transmission Corridor (TSPTC). In tandem, DWS Group commits technical and financial support, fortifying the development and operation of these solar plants. \n",
      "The second agreement marks a significant investment of $500 million by DWS Group into Nigerian renewable energy projects, mainly focusing on solar initiatives. This is a welcome boost for Nigeria’s economy, as it will create new opportunities for income, employment, and improved access to affordable electricity. It will also help Nigeria diversify its energy mix, reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate its environmental impact. Union Bank of Nigeria and local stakeholders will work together to identify, finance, and implement these projects.\n",
      "These agreements are not only beneficial for Nigeria and Germany, but also for the world at large. They align with both countries’ commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure a sustainable energy future for all. They also reflect the spirit of international collaboration, which is essential for tackling the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the energy transition and climate crisis.\n",
      "President Tinubu deserves praise for his visionary leadership and his unwavering support for these agreements. He has shown that Nigeria is not only a willing partner, but also a leader in renewable energy, particularly solar power. He has also reaffirmed Nigeria’s determination to embrace a sustainable energy future, and to cooperate with other nations in achieving this goal.\n",

      "30 October 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/10/30/opinion-why-nigerias-bilateral-relations-matter-and-how-president-tinubu-is-improving-them/\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria, a nation teeming with potential and diversity, stands at a pivotal juncture in its history. With a population exceeding 200 million and a GDP surpassing $400 billion, it’s undeniable that Nigeria is a regional powerhouse in Africa. However, the complexities and challenges that have punctuated its bilateral relations with the world have been undeniable, raising questions about the country’s future trajectory.\n",
      "Bilateral relations serve as the lifeblood of a nation’s diplomacy, playing a pivotal role in shaping its economic development, security, and global standing. In the Nigerian context, these relations have not always been smooth, often tainted by conflict and discord with neighboring countries and key trading partners. Yet, President Bola Tinubu, who assumed office in May 2023 following a contentious election, has made it abundantly clear that enhancing Nigeria’s bilateral relations is at the forefront of his agenda. \n",
      "One of President Tinubu’s notable approaches has been an extensive outreach to countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This approach seeks to strengthen existing relationships and uncover new opportunities for trade, investment, and cooperation. High-profile meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been instrumental in fortifying Nigeria’s global connections.\n",
      "Moreover, Nigeria’s participation in various multilateral forums and initiatives underscores its dedication to global peace, security, development, and cooperation. President Tinubu’s leadership within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), co-hosting the Africa Investment Forum, involvement in the G20 Summit, support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), endorsement of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations illustrate the nation’s proactive role in addressing regional and global concerns.\n",
      "The results of these endeavors have been palpable, with Nigeria witnessing substantial improvements in its diplomatic relations, trade and investment, and security. It has also garnered greater respect on the international stage as it plays a constructive role in addressing critical issues. Yet, challenges remain and room for further improvement is evident.\n",
      "To continue this positive trajectory, Nigeria must maintain its pursuit of reforms that enhance governance, economic stability, infrastructure, and human capital. Striking a delicate balance between its interests and values, especially in situations where they diverge, is essential. Diversifying partnerships and engagements, including with less familiar or friendly nations, will further fortify its position.\n",
      "Nigeria’s bilateral relations serve as a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The ultimate objective is to transform Nigeria into a prosperous, secure, democratic, and influential nation. Under President Tinubu’s leadership, the country is taking significant strides toward this goal. In the dynamic world of international relations, Nigeria is firmly positioning itself as the giant of Africa, ready to embrace the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\n",

      "Imagine a world where no one goes hungry, where Africa feeds itself and the rest of the world. This is not a fantasy, but a possibility, thanks to a historic $1 billion pledge for Nigeria’s agriculture.\n",
      "This game-changing investment, led by Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), will create Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs) in Nigeria and 12 other African countries. These zones will boost productivity, value addition, and market access for farmers and agribusinesses. \n",
      "The AfDB and its partners have committed $1.5 billion to support SAPZs in Africa, with Nigeria receiving the largest share. Nigeria, being the most populous and largest economy on the continent, has the potential to transform its agriculture sector and catalyze regional development.\n",
      "With 283 million people still suffering from hunger in Africa, there is an urgent need to harness the continent’s vast agricultural resources for food security and self-reliance. This investment comes at a crucial time to address these challenges and promote sustainable development.\n",
      "The visionary leadership demonstrated by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Macky Sall of Senegal, and Abdel Fattah El-Sisi of Egypt deserves recognition. Their commitment to progress and development heralds a new era of leadership in Africa.\n",
      "The ambitious goals outlined by Vice President Kashim Shettima for wheat and rice production, involving heat-tolerant seeds, expanded irrigation, farmer support, and accessible financing, are crucial steps towards achieving self-sufficiency in Nigeria’s agriculture.\n",
      "The SAPZs will also have a dedicated authority to address regulatory issues and create an investor-friendly environment. By streamlining regulations and providing a conducive atmosphere, Nigeria aims to attract both domestic and foreign investors, fostering innovation and technology transfer in the sector.\n",
      "The billion-dollar pledge for Nigeria’s SAPZs is not just a financial support but a transformative effort for the nation’s agriculture. It offers an opportunity to unlock Africa’s agricultural potential, not only for self-sufficiency but also as a potential food provider to the world. It highlights the importance of visionary leadership and has the potential to drive Nigeria towards food security, ushering in a new era of agricultural prosperity for the entire continent.\n",
      "In conclusion, the $1 billion pledge for Nigeria’s SAPZs is a significant step towards transforming the country’s agriculture sector. It presents a unique opportunity to unlock Nigeria’s agricultural potential while serving as an example for other African countries. With visionary leaders at the helm and strategic investments, Africa can overcome food insecurity, drive economic growth, and become a major contributor to global food production. Let us celebrate this historic initiative and look forward to a future where agriculture takes center stage in Africa’s progress.\n",

      "Some financial experts have commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its decision to redesign the naira, saying that it would have positive effect on the economy.\n",
      "The experts spoke in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Thursday. \n",
      "They spoke against the backdrop of announcement by the CBN that new designs of the N200, N500 and N1,000 denominations would be produced and circulated on Dec. 15.\n",
      "According to Prof. Umhe Uwaleke, a financial economist and professor of capital market at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, the decision will be positive for the economy in the medium to long term.\n",
      "Uwaleke said the measure would go a long way to ensure that the naira in circulation outside the banking system were brought into the banking system.\n",
      "He said the measure would also provide enough liquidity for banks, and more money for the banks to lend.\n",
      "“The measure does not amount to demonetisation of big currency notes often carried out by central banks to curb black money and corruption.\n",
      "“But it will go a long way in ensuring that a lot of naira notes circulating outside the banks are crowded in.\n",
      "“If it leads to large deposits in banks, it means the banks will have more money to lend which may reduce interest rates.\n",
      "“Perhaps more importantly, with increased currency in circulation now in the vault of banks, I expect to see improvement in monetary policy transmission,” he said.\n",
      "Uwaleke said it might also have the effect of reducing speculative attacks on the naira in the parallel market in the medium term.\n",
      "“I expect that the Financial Intelligence Unit will be on the look out for huge deposits as a way of monitoring illegitimate transactions.\n",
      "“Despite the huge cost involved in changing currency notes, I think it’s time to sanitise the system, especially now that electioneering activities have kicked off,” he said.\n",
      "He, however, said the deadline of Jan. 31, 2023 was too short, considering the number of naira denominations involved, urging the CBN to consider extending it.\n",
      "An economist, Dr Tope Fasua, also said the measure would have significant effect on the economy, adding that it was essentially about “black money.”\n",
      "He suggested that the CBN should take such measures more frequently.\n",
      "“When central banks do this, they try to pull in monies people are hiding; illegal money, corruption money, kidnapping money. Nigeria has managed to become a hub for these kinds of illegalities.\n",
      "“I will even suggest that the CBN does this more often, maybe every 10 years. You will see a scenario where the banks are awash with liquidity.\n",
      "“There are many people sitting on billions in naira, and even in dollars. The CBN should also see how it can pull in the dollars,” he said.\n",
      "Fasua advised that the idea of individuals operating personal domiciliary bank accounts should be banned, adding that nobody needed it.\n",
      "“People are speculating against their own currency in their own country. That is not allowed in any economy.\n",
      "“They should pull in illegal, black naira and then see how they can pull in illegal dollars. The CBN can control these things through the Deposit Money Banks,” he said.\n",

      "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed has disclosed the plans of the Federal Government to stop payment of petrol subsidy in June 2023.\n",
      "Ahmed disclosed this when she appeared before the house of representatives ad hoc committee investigating petrol subsidy. \n",
      "The FG had had made known its projection to spend N6.7 trillion for payment of petrol subsidy in 2023.\n",
      "However, Ahmed confirmed that the projected amount has been cut down to N3.35 trillion as contained in the 2023-2035 medium term expenditure framework and fiscal strategy paper (MTEF&FSP).\n",
      "She said, “One thing that stands out in the MTEF was that if the nation holds on to fuel subsidy as it is designed now, we will be incurring — from January to December — a subsidy cost of N6.4 trillion. But we suggested to the federal executive council (FEC) and the council approved that, maybe, we could look at the option of exiting the subsidy regime half-year. So, if we did that, then the cost would be N3.35 trillion, which is half of the N6.7 trillion,”\n",
      "Ahmed added that the subsidy plan was not sustainable, saying that it might compel the government to borrowing in 2023.\n",
      "She noted that the subsidy scheme was putting the country’s finance in jeopardy, but that plan is underway to get the country out of the subsidy regime as soon as possible.\n",
      "The finance minister also gave a rundown of the withdrawals from the consolidated revenue fund (CRF) and the excess crude account (ECA) for payments to oil marketers during the subsidy regime.\n",
      "“Deduction of PMS under recovery shortfall by NNPC for the period 2013 to 2022: We are reporting that there is a total sum of N4.436 trillion which was deducted as PMS under-recovery by NNPC for the period January 2013 to December 2021.\n",
      "“In this report, we are reporting the sum of N1.774 trillion has been paid to independent oil marketers as subsidies from 2013 to 2016.\n",
      "“I will like to call the attention of the committee to note that the total sum of N6.210 trillion – that is the N4.4 trillion plus the N1.774 trillion – was expended on PMS under-recovery by NNPC as well as payment of subsidy to independent oil marketers from 2013 to 2021.\n",
      "“I want to report on the funding of subsidy payments to independent oil marketers for 2013 to 2016. Payments that have been made to them were directly from the domestic excess crude account (ECA) through the reduction of sovereign debts instruments that we call the SDIs.\n",
      "“The SDIs are negotiable short-term instruments that were issued by the government at that time to give marketers comfort and enable them access financial support from their bankers for the importation of PMS. The instrument was approved by the then president in 2010.\n",
      "“It is also important to note that there were instances where funds were transferred from the consolidated revenue fund (CRF) to the domestic excess crude account for subsidy payments.\n",
      "“For 2015, there are two instances: N31 billion from the FGN’s excess domestic account, transferred from the CRF. Again in 2015, N156.1 billion transferred from the CRF in another instance to the domestic excess crude account,” she said.\n",

      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",

The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "–          Collected N300 million as kickback from bank\n",
      "–          Supplied sand mixed with chemical as fertilizer \n",
      "The Minister of Defense (state), Dr. Muhammad Bello Matawalle has reacted to the recent allegations by the current governor of Zamfara state, Dauda Lawal Dare about his past government, clearing that the governor is after him because he rejected his attempt to scam him while he was governor.\n",
      "Matawalle who is the immediate past governor of the state said he has done his best for the state, and the current governor is angry and envying his ministerial position. He added that he has done some things in the past that made Dauda angry, which made him cook allegations against him.\n",
      "Speaking to DCL Hausa in an interview, the Minister said instead of spreading fake allegations, the governor should focus his attention on finding lasting solutions to the problems of the state, as he rightly did during his tenure.\n",
      "“I didn’t intend to talk about these issues, but it has become necessary for people to know. He is mounting pressure to just blackmail me, not knowing that I have laid a foundation that can never be destroyed in both Zamfara state and the National level. We have done our best for the state in the past four years and the good people of the state can attest to that,” the Defense Minister said.\n",
      "The former governor further disclosed that he had trusted Dauda Lawal with some projects while he was the governor of Zamfara State, but “He deceived and cheated on me and the state.”\n",
      "‘Why Lawal Dare is after me’\n",
      "According to him, the main reason why the present governor is angry with him is because he (Governor Lawal Dauda) attempted to hijack some contracts to supply fertilizer and bank loans to the state when the minister was the governor.\n",
      "“Lawal Dare (Dauda) came to me when I was the governor that he brought a bank that will give us a loan of N30 billion. But at the end he connived and collected N300 million from the bank as a commission, which was later confiscated by EFCC.\n",
      "“He also came to me that he wanted to supply fertilizer to me and we signed a contract of over N4 billion. But for over seven months he couldn’t. He later told me that he doesn’t have money and a certificate. I gave him a certificate but still he couldn’t. Yet, I also agreed that he should bring 120 trailers at the cost of N504 million, but he couldn’t,” he said.\n",
      "Matawalle added that, “That time he could only bring 10 trailers and had been disturbing that I should give him money, but I refused because I wanted him to supply the whole fertilizer before we could settle him. But to my surprise, after distributing the fertilizer, it was discovered that he just mixed sand with chemicals. Which meant he deceived us. This was the beginning of our problem with him.”\n",
      "The minister added that another major issue between them is how he emerged as  Minister of Defense, he explained that Dauda Lawal did not want him to get this position and thus has been mounting allegations and accusations against him ever since.\n",
      "“He is angry that I am now a minister, not knowing that I have gone far. I am a minister and I will focus my attention on delivering my assigned responsibilities. All my life I don’t have time to fight or belong to where I am not needed. That is why I didn’t want to talk about him, but I have to because the noise is too much. I have to let the world know what is actually happening,” he added.\n",
      "Focus on Zamfara and stop playing our people\n",
      "Matawalle further advised the state governor to stop deceiving his people and requested he should focus on his primary assignment of leading the state and ensuring that the security of life of the people of Zamfara state.\n",
      "“Instead of spreading lies against me, Lawal Dauda should focus on the state. He should cooperate with the security personnel in finding lasting solutions to the security challenges bedeviling our dear state. This is what I did in my tenure.\n",
      "“We all know what is happening in our state for a long time. Both of us inherited challenges of security, but our focus should all be on ending it. I have been nice to him. Even when he became the governor, I prayed for him to be the reason for finding lasting solutions to the security challenges in our state.”\n",
      "According to Matawalle, “We all love Zamfara state that is why we want to support him. We are after the development of the state. So I think it is high time that he should concentrate on the state, not spreading mere allegations and rumors.\n",
      "“For someone who said he loves Zamfara state, he is not staying in the state. I have been staying there despite the security challenges. Anytime there is a problem he will be nowhere to be found in the state. Even in the recent crisis, we attempted to go to the state, but when we called him, he told us he is in the US. At a time when you are facing security challenges, but you are busy touring Europe.”\n",
      "He debunked other allegations by the governor on the claims of spending sums on Airport, education, Ruga and some road projects across the state, as well as the recent medicines that arrived the state that were earlier purchased by the Matwalle administration.\n",
      "“There was a time when Zamfara was the last in education, but during my tenure we were able to improve and became fourteenth. We all have the records. We know how he destroyed our roads and other legacies mainly to paint us black in the mind of Zamfara people. What are all these? Doesn’t he have projects to do for the state?\n",
      "“Dauda let me tell you that Matawalle is a minister. You cannot remove me from the position, and you cannot force someone to remove me either. Everything has its time. I want to advise you to go and work for the people of Zamfara state. Stop spending their money unnecessarily.”\n",

      "\n",
      "by Fredrick Nwabufo\n",
      "Excellence needs no hype, makeover, or agitprop. Good work manifests itself in palpable reality. The security bent of the Tinubu administration is an exercise of deliberate, coordinated, meticulous and prescient deployment of strategies and actions to secure Nigeria. It is securing Nigeria pluck by pluck — with inexorable courage, purpose, and urgency. \n",
      "A large part of success in security operations lies in ICC – interagency cooperation and coordination. What more demonstrates this plank than the synergised effort between the Department of State Services and the army in precluding what could have been a devastating blow, with a sludge of casualties in Kano?\n",
      "On November 3, the symbiotic effort of the Nigerian Army and the DSS led to the successful foiling of an attack on Kano by insurgents. The insurgents had been machinating a marquee attack, that could, perhaps, dampen citizens’ confidence, on the State. A detachment of soldiers and DSS operatives swooped on the sanctuary of the subversives in a dawn blitz in Gezawa Local Government Area of Kano State, arresting the henchmen.\n",
      "The joint team recovered five AK-47 rifles, five AK-47 rifle magazines, one rocket-propelled gun (RPG), five RPG bombs, six hand grenades, five pairs of desert camouflage uniforms, 10 pairs of magazine pouches and some improvised-explosive device (IED) making materials.\n",
      "Obviously, the success of this operation is implicit in the cooperation and coordination between the army and the DSS, as well as in the actioning of intelligence. What imperils security anywhere in the world is, partly, interagency rivalry and the absence of coordination — when intelligence is available, but actioning is a challenge owing to some contentions.\n",
      "On November 2, the allied effort of the army and the police resulted in the rescuing of two corps members. Bandits had kidnapped the corps members who were transiting from Edo State in Yargoje community, Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. But the purposive and united endeavour of the security agencies led to the safe return of the hostages.\n",
      "Interagency cooperation and coordination (ICC) is pivotal for securing Nigeria. It is elemental for achieving the priority objective of the administration, which is strengthening national security for peace and security.\n",
      "Since July 2023, the security forces have chalked up reasonable gains against subversives without a noising of the winnings. There is a fillip in security operations across the country. Since the past week, for instance, there has been intensive air strikes against the troublers of our nation.\n",
      "In the north-west, the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji on November 1, conducted a slew of successful air strikes in Kankara Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State, targeting the hermitage of a terrorist kingpin, who is responsible for a chain of terrorist acts and banditry across Kankara and adjacent LGAs in the state.\n",
      "The air strikes removed clusters of refuge used as hideaways by the kingpin and his gang, effectively dismantling their base of operation. Only Very few survivors escaped the furry of the Nigeria Air force.\n",
      "In the north-east, precision air strikes by the air component of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK) on November 3, led to the elimination of several terrorists at their rendezvous, near Degbawa in Goza Local Government Area of Borno State. The terrorists were responsible for the recent attack on some locals in Geidam on October 31, and had planned to meet to review the attack as well as the next line of onslaught on innocent Nigerians and other vulnerable targets.\n",
      "In the south-east, security agencies have sustained incisive operations, rooting out units of IPOB/ESN terrorists from the area. Peace and normalcy are returning, just as citizens’ confidence is witnessing a reinforcement. For instance, On October 5, troops of Operation UDO KA II conducted raids on the haven of the terrorists around Ihiom-Ihittenansa in Orsu Local Government Area and Okigwe-Umulolo in Okigwe Local Government Area of Imo State.\n",
      "The operational base and shrines of the subversives were erased, two suspects arrested, and a cache of arms recovered. This includes ammunition, one PKT machine gun barrel, one locally made rocket-propelled launcher (Ogbunigwe) and IED making materials. In many other operations, imminent attacks had been thwarted, IPOB/ESN terrorists removed and arrested; criminal hermitages destroyed, hostages freed, and arms and ammunition recovered.\n",
      "Further operations are in progress in the north-central, south-south, and south-west. Across these zones, criminal hideouts have been extirpated, threats neutralised, arms and ammunition recovered, suspects arrested, and kidnap victims rescued.\n",
      "These sustained efforts, successes, cooperation, and coordination among the security agencies clearly say there is a responsible, and strategic national security leadership. There is purpose, there is direction; there is commitment, there is the will and the way, and there is a sense of urgency.\n",
      "Securing Nigeria is a principal objective of the Renewed Hope charter. The Tinubu administration has exercised responsibility with significant gains in the sphere of security since assumption of office. Although there is more to be done and will be done, the administration is wholly committed to removing security threats and securing law-abiding Nigerians anywhere in the country.\n",

      "2 December 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/12/02/cop28-revisiting-president-tinubus-church-rat-analogy/\n",
      "\n",
      "By Michael Chibuzo\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s attendance at the 10th German-Nigeria Business Forum in Berlin was a pivotal moment witnessing the signing of two groundbreaking Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) between Union Bank of Nigeria and DWS Group. These MoUs aim to revolutionize the landscape of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in both Nigeria and Germany.\n",
      "The specifics of the first MoU delineate a pathway for energy export from Nigeria to Germany, utilizing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the European Union – African Union Partnership. This agreement empowers Union Bank of Nigeria to oversee the exportation of solar-generated electricity to Germany via established conduits such as the West African Power Pool (WAPP) and the Trans-Saharan Power Transmission Corridor (TSPTC). In tandem, DWS Group commits technical and financial support, fortifying the development and operation of these solar plants. \n",
      "The second agreement marks a significant investment of $500 million by DWS Group into Nigerian renewable energy projects, mainly focusing on solar initiatives. This is a welcome boost for Nigeria’s economy, as it will create new opportunities for income, employment, and improved access to affordable electricity. It will also help Nigeria diversify its energy mix, reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, and mitigate its environmental impact. Union Bank of Nigeria and local stakeholders will work together to identify, finance, and implement these projects.\n",
      "These agreements are not only beneficial for Nigeria and Germany, but also for the world at large. They align with both countries’ commitments to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals, which aim to ensure a sustainable energy future for all. They also reflect the spirit of international collaboration, which is essential for tackling the challenges and seizing the opportunities presented by the energy transition and climate crisis.\n",
      "President Tinubu deserves praise for his visionary leadership and his unwavering support for these agreements. He has shown that Nigeria is not only a willing partner, but also a leader in renewable energy, particularly solar power. He has also reaffirmed Nigeria’s determination to embrace a sustainable energy future, and to cooperate with other nations in achieving this goal.\n",
      "The signing of these agreements is a milestone in Nigerian-German relations, and a testament to the strength and potential of their partnership. It is also a sign of hope and optimism for the future of renewable energy, and a step towards a brighter, greener future.\n",

      "Tinubu’s visionary leadership and strategic intelligence have earned him global respect and admiration. He knows that Nigeria needs to diversify its economy, create jobs, and improve its infrastructure, and he has pursued these goals with steadfast determination and a realistic approach. \n",
      "The multi-billion dollar deals with Saudi Arabia cover crucial sectors such as oil and gas, agriculture, power, and technology. These deals are not only expected to boost Nigeria’s economic foundations but also to encourage innovation and cooperation. Especially noteworthy is Saudi Arabia’s promise to help Nigeria revive its failing refineries, which have suffered from decades of mismanagement, corruption, and inefficiency.\n",
      "The cooperation represents a mutually beneficial partnership where Nigeria can gain from Saudi expertise, capital injection, and wider market access. At the same time, Saudi Arabia can benefit from Nigeria’s potential, resources, and population. Tinubu’s ability to forge such strategic partnerships shows his dedication to advancing Nigeria’s national interests and enhancing its role on the regional and global stage.\n",
      "Tinubu’s victory is a reason for celebration and optimism for all Nigerians, who deserve a better future. As he continues to show transformative leadership, Tinubu has proven himself as the leader Nigeria needs. It is vital for the nation to support him, recognizing the possibility for positive change and progress that his strategic initiatives offer.\n",
      "President Bola Tinubu has taken a major step towards consolidating Nigeria’s economic ties with Saudi Arabia by approving the creation of a business council focused on implementing investments worth billions of dollars. This strategic move follows an initial agreement between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia in 2019, initiated by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. However, the previously established council remained inactive after the agreement was reached.\n",
      "Under Tinubu’s administration, a renewed commitment has been secured with Saudi Arabia to channel investments into key sectors such as agriculture, oil and gas, energy (electricity), telecommunications, and technology. This revival in cooperation signifies a proactive effort by Tinubu’s team to activate dormant agreements, creating a climate conducive to economic growth.\n",
      "Moreover, the prospect of additional deals set to materialize before the year ends highlights the effectiveness of Tinubu’s diplomatic efforts. This victory not only stands as a proof of his leadership but also as a significant win for the federal government and Tinubu’s devoted team.\n",
      "The far-reaching impact of these agreements goes beyond diplomatic victories. The injection of investments into sectors like agriculture, oil and gas, energy, telecommunications, and technology promises to be a catalyst for job creation, playing a key role in reducing the problem of unemployment. Additionally, the economic benefits are expected to contribute considerably to increased revenue for the country, aligning with Tinubu’s wider vision for Nigeria’s economic revival.\n",
      "As President Tinubu continues to navigate the intricate landscape of international relations, the active pursuit of agreements and the tangible results achieved underscore his commitment to positioning Nigeria as a global economic player and a hub for innovation and development.\n",

      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/10/30/opinion-why-nigerias-bilateral-relations-matter-and-how-president-tinubu-is-improving-them/\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria, a nation teeming with potential and diversity, stands at a pivotal juncture in its history. With a population exceeding 200 million and a GDP surpassing $400 billion, it’s undeniable that Nigeria is a regional powerhouse in Africa. However, the complexities and challenges that have punctuated its bilateral relations with the world have been undeniable, raising questions about the country’s future trajectory.\n",
      "Bilateral relations serve as the lifeblood of a nation’s diplomacy, playing a pivotal role in shaping its economic development, security, and global standing. In the Nigerian context, these relations have not always been smooth, often tainted by conflict and discord with neighboring countries and key trading partners. Yet, President Bola Tinubu, who assumed office in May 2023 following a contentious election, has made it abundantly clear that enhancing Nigeria’s bilateral relations is at the forefront of his agenda. \n",
      "One of President Tinubu’s notable approaches has been an extensive outreach to countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This approach seeks to strengthen existing relationships and uncover new opportunities for trade, investment, and cooperation. High-profile meetings with leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, U.S. President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been instrumental in fortifying Nigeria’s global connections.\n",
      "Moreover, Nigeria’s participation in various multilateral forums and initiatives underscores its dedication to global peace, security, development, and cooperation. President Tinubu’s leadership within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), co-hosting the Africa Investment Forum, involvement in the G20 Summit, support for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), endorsement of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and contributions to United Nations Peacekeeping Operations illustrate the nation’s proactive role in addressing regional and global concerns.\n",
      "The results of these endeavors have been palpable, with Nigeria witnessing substantial improvements in its diplomatic relations, trade and investment, and security. It has also garnered greater respect on the international stage as it plays a constructive role in addressing critical issues. Yet, challenges remain and room for further improvement is evident.\n",
      "To continue this positive trajectory, Nigeria must maintain its pursuit of reforms that enhance governance, economic stability, infrastructure, and human capital. Striking a delicate balance between its interests and values, especially in situations where they diverge, is essential. Diversifying partnerships and engagements, including with less familiar or friendly nations, will further fortify its position.\n",
      "Nigeria’s bilateral relations serve as a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The ultimate objective is to transform Nigeria into a prosperous, secure, democratic, and influential nation. Under President Tinubu’s leadership, the country is taking significant strides toward this goal. In the dynamic world of international relations, Nigeria is firmly positioning itself as the giant of Africa, ready to embrace the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.\n",

      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",
      "When the world comes together to take actions on achieving a common goal and proffer collective solutions to a nagging global concern, there are parties involved from government, private sector, civil society, media and multilateral institutions. The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "By Michael Chibuzo\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "On Friday, 2nd December, 2023 Anambra political scene will witness a seismic shift and an informal change of baton following the formal entry of two political heavyweights in Anambra State, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife into the All Progressives Congress fold in what promises to be an era-defining moment. \n",
      "Few weeks ago, the Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Distinguished Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, joined the APC on the floor of the red hallowed chamber. This political move sent shivers down the spine of Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) back home in Anambra State. Soludo immediately placed himself on 2025 campaign mode.\n",
      "Soludo and the APGA hierarchy, who are yet to recover from news of Sen. Ubah’s entry into APC now have the double misfortune to contend with the anticipated entrance of Senator Uche Ekwunife into APC! This has understandably multiplied their headaches. APGA is daily witnessing a resurgent rise of the All Progressives Congress in Anambra State.\n",
      "The entry of the duo of Senator Ubah and Ekwunife will drastically bolster the ranks of the APC in Anambra State and turn it to the party with the most formidable assemblage of the most progressive heavyweight politicians in Anambra. In case APGA still do not understand the shape of the new united Anambra APC that is emerging, it is necessary to briefly remind them.\n",
      "Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife are joining thoroughbred progressives in APC such as the DG, National Planning Commission, Dr. Ben Akabueze, Chief Sylvester Okonkwo (Chief of Staff to the Senate President), Barr. Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye (Women Affairs Minister), Dr. Chioma Ejikeme (Executive Secretary PTAD), Sen. Andy Uba, Dr. Chris Ngige, Dr. George Moghalu, Engr. Azuka Okwuosa, Chief Johnbosco Onunkwo, Sir Paul Chukwuma, Chief Chibuzo Obiakor, Chief Uche Nworah, Sen. Margery Okadigbo, Mrs. Sharon Ikeazor, Chief Kodilichukwu, Sir Ifeanyi Ibezim, and a host of other distinguished individuals too numerous to mention here.\n",
      "Beyond the assemblage of these heavyweight individuals, the APC boasts in its rank and file, the most intelligent and patriotic support base in Anambra State. These are people who understand what governance in a 21st century ought to be. With the newfound unity and determination in place today in Anambra State APC chapter, it is almost impossible for APGA to withstand or resist the tsunamic quest for good governance that the new APC will rally round ndi Anambra to champion henceforth.\n",
      "The Soludo administration is now fully on campaign mode instead of governance judging from the streaks of propaganda flowing out from the state government media machinery. For instance, federal rice palliatives are now being christened *Soludo palliatives* and shared to APGA supporters in 10kg bags branded conspicuously with Soludo and APGA images. This is in stark contrast to what was seen in many other states sizeable palliatives were shared without political undertones.\n",
      "Also the State Governor keeps regurgitating stale and audio promises of tax rebates to low income businesses and artisans anywhere he goes while his aides never fail to package free universal basic education, which has been in place for more than two decades as a phantom achievement of the Governor. Anything hypable is hyped by the Soludo propaganda machinery in an attempt to hoodwink ndi Anambra to believe ‘Solution is here’ and plead for another term for the governor.\n",
      "However ndi Anambra are wiser now, to them, solution is not written on signboards and expensive billboards but on the things they can see and feel. They cannot reinforce failure or subpar performance. As of today, ndi Anambra only see and feel deceit, unfulfilled promises, chaos, confusion in governance and opaqueness as far as the administration of Charles Soludo is concerned. They are ready to change vehicle and driver come 2025.\n",
      "Luckily, the APC is building a brand new modern and progressive political vehicle to ferry ndi Anambra to our desired destination come 2025. The entry of Sen. Ifeanyi Ubah and Sen. Uche Ekwunife into the party has drastically increased the pace of this process. In 2025, Ndi Anambra will be presented with a competent driver for this alternative new vehicle alongside a smart and highly reliable conductor. With this combination, Anambra’s journey to a truly working modern city state will commence in earnest.\n",

      "\n",
      "In Nigeria, the healthcare system is grappling with a major issue -the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within hospitals. This distressing trend not only threatens the lives and well-being of patients but also undermines the overall credibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system in the country. It is crucial to address this issue urgently, the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within its hospitals. This pervasive problem not only jeopardizes the health and safety of patients but also undermines the credibility and integrity of the healthcare profession as a whole.\n",
      "One of the concerning aspects of this issue is the unfair attribution of gross misconduct to volunteers, despite their significant contributions to the healthcare system, particularly in primary healthcare settings. Volunteers are often the backbone of support when it comes to human resources in these facilities. They selflessly dedicate their time and expertise to assist in delivering much-needed healthcare services to underserved communities. However, due to the actions of a few unscrupulous individuals, volunteers are erroneously held responsible for cases of gross misconduct. \n",
      "It is crucial to recognize that the majority of health or medical supporting staff in private hospitals are quacks or engaged in misconduct. This alarming trend can be attributed in part to the lack of effective regulatory bodies in the country. Inadequate oversight and enforcement mechanisms allow these unqualified individuals to operate freely, putting the lives of innocent patients at risk. Such misconduct ranges from prescribing incorrect medications to performing procedures without proper training and expertise.\n",
      "To address this growing concern, the Nigerian government must take immediate action and implement substantial modalities for volunteers to prevent the proliferation of quackery. These modalities are; \n",
      "-Database and registration (Licensing)\n",
      "-Continuous Professional Development\n",
      "-Training programs and certification courses\n",
      "-Centralized Information System\n",
      "-Monitoring and Evaluation\n",
      "-Investigation and Action\n",
      "-Reporting and Complaint Mechanisms\n",
      "-Collaboration and Information Sharing.\n",
      " Together with robust supervision, should be made mandatory for all volunteers. This will not only equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge but also ensure a higher standard of care for patients.\n",
      "It is imperative to strengthen regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring and disciplining healthcare practitioners. Stricter guidelines and regular inspections should be put in place to identify and eliminate quack practitioners. These bodies should collaborate with relevant stakeholders to improve the overall quality of healthcare services provided in both public and private hospitals.\n",
      "Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate the general population about the dangers of seeking care from unqualified individuals. Emphasizing the importance of verifying the credentials of healthcare providers before seeking their services can help curb the demand for quacks. Encouraging patients to report any cases of misconduct or malpractice they encounter will also aid in identifying and apprehending these illegal practitioners.\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing the burden of quack practitioners and gross misconduct in Nigerian hospitals requires the collective efforts of the government, regulatory bodies, healthcare professionals, and the public. Volunteers should be recognized and supported for their invaluable contributions, while measures should be taken to weed out quack practitioners and strengthen the healthcare system’s regulatory framework. By implementing adequate modalities and promoting a culture of accountability, Nigeria can ensure that its citizens receive reliable and quality healthcare services.\n",

      "There is a global consensus that universal access to healthcare is an essential human right which is critical to sustainable development. Nigeria is yet to adopt innovative ways to protect the poor and vulnerable populations against financial risk of ill health. It is important to guarantee by law the right to health care of all citizens in Nigeria. Although the National Health Act (NHA) that was signed into law in 2014 states that all Nigerians are entitled to basic minimum package of health care services.\n",
      "Given that “A healthy people is a healthy nation” and considering the poor health infrastructure he inherited from the previous administration, the Governor Yahaya Bello-led administration in Kogi State left no one in doubt about his commitment to reversing the trend. Thus the health sector became his topmost priority and he embarked on a massive revamp of the sector.\n",
      "Some of his interventions include renovation, remodeling and re-equipping of 21 existing Primary Health Care Centres (one per Local Government) with solar-powered boreholes and electrification to help the success of the Healthcare-Plus Programme, a microcosm of the Governor’s State Health Insurance Scheme (SHIS).\n",
      "To further achieve good, quality health services, as well as increase access to services at all levels, all Primary Health Care facilities in the State were put under one roof. The National Health Act. 2014 provides for the operationalisation of Primary Health Care under One Roof (PHCUOR) by States and establishment of Local Government Health Authorities (LGHA) at the Local Government levels as conditions for benefiting from the Basic Health Care Provision Fund.\n",
      "There is no doubting the fact that no sector has received as much attention as the Health sector since Governor Bello came to power. Aside from the completed state-of-the-art Medical Diagnostic Centre in the State that will arguably become the best in the country, lots of other health benefit programmes have been going on, one of which is the Healthcare Plus concept that has been applauded as one chef d’oeuvre intervention scheme across the Federation.\n",
      "Recently, on behalf of Image Merchants Promotion Ltd (IMPR), publishers of PRNigeria, Economic Confidential, Politics Digest and other titles, I was privileged to be part of a media tour of the state meant to unravel all the giant strides of the present administration and to confirm all we have gotten from secondary sources about the governor’s achievements. When we met the Commissioner for Health, Dr Saka Haruna, he was excited about telling us what he and the governor have accomplished in the health sector in the state.\n",
      "He said the Healthcare Plus was an intervention mechanism introduced to help pregnant women and nursing mothers get on with life with less stress and more smile.\n",
      "He described the scheme as one of the best healthcare policies in the country. The programme, he said, makes it possible for pregnant women to have access to medical services across the state and at no cost. With this scheme, child/maternal mortality which was very high prior to 2016, has drastically reduced.\n",
      "He stated that the long term plan of the administration had been to put in place a list of world class Teaching Hospitals, General Hospitals and Reference Hospitals that can rival anyone anywhere in the country as part of measures to stop medical tourism.\n",
      "That took the conversation to the gigantic Reference Hospital the governor is building in Okene which is said to be one of the best in the country.\n",
      "“Many of the equipment that will be deployed at the hospital are already available, like the Hyperbaric oxygen treatment chamber which is debuting Nigeria for the first time, fully furnished cardiology suites where investigative and interventional therapy will be carried out, are also available. A diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that has an AP lab and a Cat lab are all coming into the country for the first time,” the Commissioner said.\n",
      "The Commissioner encouraged us to visit the Hospital and see things for ourselves. He assured us if we take the pain to go there we wont regret the adventure.\n",
      "On getting to Okene where the Hospital is located, we were not disappointed. What we saw was an imposing 300-bed capacity Hospital which was at an advanced stage of construction and which is expected to be completed in August this year.\n",
      "A world class Reference Hospital for the treatment of advanced medical conditions that have been forcing Kogites and Nigerians to go abroad in search of succour, it has Female Wards Male Wards, Emergency Wards, Surgical Wards, Medical Wards, VIP Ward, VVIP Wards, all of which are ten each in number. It also has a Ward for Renal ailments and another one for Dental issues. It has two different Laboratories (Hematology Lab and Histopathology Lab).\n",

      "President TeamNigera4Change, Bestman Jumbo-Nze has described findings of opinion poll conducted by Best Media Consultants as the true reflection of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s performance in Lagos. \n",
      "Best man Jumbo-Nze noted that the verdict of Sanwolu as the best governor using the criteria underscored the position of Lagos residents about their governor.\n",
      "He said the work the governor has done in the state is devoid of the usual media hype which underscores the humility attribute of Sanwo-olu\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu  emerged as the overall best governor in handling of Covid 19 pandemic, security, infrastructure, economy, political sagacity, humility and environment/waste management in report published by the research group last week.\n",
      "According to the report, Governor Wike of Rivers state emerged second for management of environment/waste and Covid 19.\n",
      "A statement by Best Media Consultants said the research was conducted in its quest to deepen Nigeria’s democracy and to feel the pulse of Nigerians on governance in four major commercial cities in Nigeria, namely Lagos, Abia, Kano and Rivers states.\n",
      "The group said it deployed the face-to-face interviewing technique through the use of a structured questionnaire in conducting the research.\n",
      "“Our audience have travelled to the four commercial cities not less than five (5) times in the last 24 months. They read, listen and watch core media platforms often. They were drawn from the ABC, socio economic class, they cut across both sex (male and female).All respondents were screened to eliminate political bias, interest, loyalty and sympathy. They were all non-partisan.Timing: Research study was conducted in June/July 2021\n",
      "According to the findings “With a mean score of +4.41(96%) our audience tended to believe Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu have handled Covid 19 Pandemic better than others. Governor Wike was rated +3.44 (77%).\n",
      "“Security no doubt have become a major challenge across the country, Governor Babajide was rated +3.32, on handling of security challenges in Lagos. This call for more efforts, when compared to others, he has done better than Governor Wike who was rated +2.42\n",
      "“Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu humility, is further confirmed by the findings of this research study which is non-partisan, unbiased and unsympathetic to him, his party APC and government, as all our respondents were drawn from outside his state (Lagos).\n",
      "Governor Ikpeazu came second with a measure of +3.82, while Governor Wike was seen as the arrogant amongst governors surveyed.\n",
      "“Again Governor Babajide was rated +4.42 for handling political issues in his state. To our audience, he has not had any pronounced crises with his party members since he became Governor. Governor Ikpeazu was rated +3.77, while Wike was rated +2.26 showing lack of political sagacity in handling political issues in his state.\n",
      "“With a mean score of +3.84, Governor Wike was rated to have done more in infrastructure followed by Governor Ganduje with +3.64, while Governor Babajide was rated +3.43.

      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/11/25/opinion-a-new-era-of-defence-industrialization-in-nigeria/\n",
      "\n",
      "Nigeria, a nation grappling with security challenges from terrorism to banditry, is in dire need of a formidable defence force. This force, however, is only as strong as the equipment and technology it employs. For too long, Nigeria has leaned on foreign sources for its defence needs, a dependence that has left it vulnerable to supply disruptions, price fluctuations, and quality issues.\n",
      "Our reliance on foreign sources has also stunted our ability to develop our own defence capabilities and innovations, crucial for addressing our unique security challenges. It is in this context that the recent assent of President Bola Tinubu to the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) Bill, 2023, sponsored by Hon. Babajimi Benson, should be seen as a game-changer. \n",
      "Established in 1964, DICON was designed to be the backbone of Nigeria’s defence industry. Unfortunately, due to underfunding, mismanagement, and obsolescence, its productivity and quality have dwindled. The new bill aims to revitalize DICON by giving it the power to operate and control subsidiaries and ordnance factories, establish the Defence Industry Technology, Research, and Development Institute (DITRDI), provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for the defence sector, and incentivize private capital in the defence sector.\n",
      "The potential for this bill to transform Nigeria’s defence industry is profound. It promises a vibrant and competitive sector that can meet the needs of our armed forces and contribute to our national economy. By bolstering DICON’s capacity and autonomy, the bill can help Nigeria reduce its dependence on foreign sources, save foreign exchange, create jobs, and foster innovation.\n",
      "The bill also promotes collaboration and synergy among various stakeholders in the defence sector, including the private sector and academia, stimulating growth in related industries and sectors.\n",
      "While the assent of the bill is a commendable step, it is not the end of the journey. Its implementation will require the commitment and support of the government, the military, the private sector, and the public.\n",
      "The government must ensure adequate funding and oversight for DICON and its subsidiaries, and provide the necessary legal and policy frameworks for its operations. The military must patronize and partner with DICON, providing feedback and guidance on their products and services. The private sector must invest and participate in the defence industry while adhering to ethical and professional standards. The public must support and appreciate DICON’s efforts, demanding accountability and transparency.\n",
      "Nigeria’s vision to become one of the top 20 economies in the world by 2030 hinges on a robust defence industry that can guarantee its security and prosperity. The Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria Bill, 2023, is a step in the right direction, marking the beginning of a new era of defence industrialization in Nigeria.\n",

      "6 November 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/11/06/the-burden-of-quack-practitioners-and-gross-misconduct-in-nigerian-hospitals/\n",
      "\n",
      "In Nigeria, the healthcare system is grappling with a major issue -the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within hospitals. This distressing trend not only threatens the lives and well-being of patients but also undermines the overall credibility and effectiveness of the healthcare system in the country. It is crucial to address this issue urgently, the prevalence of quack practitioners and gross misconduct within its hospitals. This pervasive problem not only jeopardizes the health and safety of patients but also undermines the credibility and integrity of the healthcare profession as a whole.\n",
      "One of the concerning aspects of this issue is the unfair attribution of gross misconduct to volunteers, despite their significant contributions to the healthcare system, particularly in primary healthcare settings. Volunteers are often the backbone of support when it comes to human resources in these facilities. They selflessly dedicate their time and expertise to assist in delivering much-needed healthcare services to underserved communities. However, due to the actions of a few unscrupulous individuals, volunteers are erroneously held responsible for cases of gross misconduct. \n",
      "It is crucial to recognize that the majority of health or medical supporting staff in private hospitals are quacks or engaged in misconduct. This alarming trend can be attributed in part to the lack of effective regulatory bodies in the country. Inadequate oversight and enforcement mechanisms allow these unqualified individuals to operate freely, putting the lives of innocent patients at risk. Such misconduct ranges from prescribing incorrect medications to performing procedures without proper training and expertise.\n",
      "To address this growing concern, the Nigerian government must take immediate action and implement substantial modalities for volunteers to prevent the proliferation of quackery. These modalities are; \n",
      "-Database and registration (Licensing)\n",
      "-Continuous Professional Development\n",
      "-Training programs and certification courses\n",
      "-Centralized Information System\n",
      "-Monitoring and Evaluation\n",
      "-Investigation and Action\n",
      "-Reporting and Complaint Mechanisms\n",
      "-Collaboration and Information Sharing.\n",
      " Together with robust supervision, should be made mandatory for all volunteers. This will not only equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge but also ensure a higher standard of care for patients.\n",
      "It is imperative to strengthen regulatory bodies responsible for monitoring and disciplining healthcare practitioners. Stricter guidelines and regular inspections should be put in place to identify and eliminate quack practitioners. These bodies should collaborate with relevant stakeholders to improve the overall quality of healthcare services provided in both public and private hospitals.\n",
      "Public awareness campaigns are essential to educate the general population about the dangers of seeking care from unqualified individuals. Emphasizing the importance of verifying the credentials of healthcare providers before seeking their services can help curb the demand for quacks. Encouraging patients to report any cases of misconduct or malpractice they encounter will also aid in identifying and apprehending these illegal practitioners.\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing the burden of quack practitioners and gross misconduct in Nigerian hospitals requires the collective efforts of the government, regulatory bodies, healthcare professionals, and the public. Volunteers should be recognized and supported for their invaluable contributions, while measures should be taken to weed out quack practitioners and strengthen the healthcare system’s regulatory framework. By implementing adequate modalities and promoting a culture of accountability, Nigeria can ensure that its citizens receive reliable and quality healthcare services.\n",

      "Nigeria is a nation on the move. A nation that is embracing the power of technology to reshape its destiny. A nation that is witnessing a digital revolution that is transforming every aspect of its society. A nation that is being led by a visionary leader who understands the importance of technology for the future of Nigeria.\n",
      "That leader is President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who took office in 2023 with a clear mandate to accelerate Nigeria’s digital transformation. Since then, he has implemented a series of policies and programs that have enhanced the digital landscape in Nigeria, creating a conducive environment for innovation, growth, and inclusion. In this opinion column, I will highlight some of the key initiatives undertaken by the Tinubu Administration in four critical sectors: fintech, agriculture, education, and technology. \n",
      "Fintech: The Financial Sector’s Game-Changer\n",
      "One of the most visible impacts of digital transformation in Nigeria can be seen in the financial sector. Fintech companies have emerged as the game-changers, offering innovative financial services to the unbanked and underbanked population. Mobile banking, digital payment solutions, and peer-to-peer lending platforms have fundamentally changed how Nigerians manage their finances. This digital revolution has not only boosted financial inclusion but has also contributed to economic growth and poverty reduction.\n",
      "President Tinubu has shown a strong support for the fintech sector, recognizing its potential to drive Nigeria’s development. He has introduced policies that foster collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech startups, creating a win-win situation for both parties. He has also established regulatory sandboxes that allow fintech companies to test their products and services in a controlled environment, without compromising the security and efficiency of financial transactions. Moreover, he has promoted the use of digital identity systems, such as the National Identification Number (NIN), to facilitate the verification and authentication of customers and transactions.\n",
      "Agriculture: Cultivating Growth through Technology\n",
      "Agriculture, the backbone of Nigeria’s economy, has also undergone a remarkable transformation through technology. From precision farming to e-commerce platforms linking farmers with buyers, technology has brought efficiency and transparency to the sector. Access to real-time weather information, mobile apps for crop management, and digital marketplaces have empowered farmers, increasing productivity and food security.\n",
      "President Tinubu has demonstrated a keen interest in improving the agricultural sector through technology. He has partnered with technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to provide farmers with access to digital tools and techniques that can enhance their farming practices. He has also invested in rural broadband infrastructure, ensuring that even remote areas have access to the benefits of digital agriculture. Furthermore, he has launched initiatives, such as the Green Imperative Program, to provide farmers with mechanization and irrigation facilities, as well as training and extension services.\n",
      "Education: Bridging the Knowledge Gap\n",
      "Digital transformation has also revolutionized Nigeria’s education sector, bridging the knowledge gap and providing access to quality education for all. E-learning platforms, online courses, and virtual classrooms have made education more accessible, especially for those in remote areas. Technology has created new opportunities for lifelong learning, skill development, and professional growth.\n",
      "President Tinubu has placed a strong emphasis on enhancing digital education in Nigeria. He has worked with educational technology providers, such as Coursera and Udemy, to equip schools with the necessary digital infrastructure and resources. He has also initiated programs, such as the Digital Literacy and Skills Program, to train teachers in digital pedagogy and develop digital content for the curriculum. Additionally, he has supported the establishment of innovation hubs and centers of excellence, such as the African University of Science and Technology, to foster research and development in science and technology.\n",
      "Technology: Building a Digital Workforce\n",
      "Technology, as a sector in itself, has witnessed tremendous growth and development in Nigeria. The country has become a hub of innovation, producing world-class tech startups and solutions. From e-commerce to ride-hailing, social media to gaming, Nigerian tech entrepreneurs have made their mark on the global stage. Technology has also created new employment opportunities, especially for the youth, who constitute the majority of the population.\n",
      "President Tinubu has shown a strong commitment to supporting and enhancing the tech sector in Nigeria. One of his flagship initiatives is the 3 Million Technical Talent (3MTT) program, which aims to train and place 3 million Nigerians in technical skills, such as software development, data science, cybersecurity, and cloud computing by 2025. The program, executed in collaboration with NITDA, will generate a pipeline of technical talent that will power Nigeria’s digital economy and position the country as a net talent exporter. President Tinubu has also introduced other policies and programs to foster the tech sector, such as streamlining regulatory processes, investing in digital infrastructure, promoting digital skills and education, and fostering collaborations with international partners .\n",
      "Nigeria is a nation that is undergoing a digital transformation that is reshaping its future. A nation that is being led by a leader who has a vision and a plan to make Nigeria a digital powerhouse. A nation that is poised to become a role model for other African countries and the world. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is the leader that Nigeria needs to achieve its digital aspirations. He is the leader that is leading Nigeria’s digital transformation.\n",

      "Following public reactions over the provision for what is termed presidential yacht and other line items in the 2023 Supplementary Appropriation presented to the National Assembly, the presidency has provided some clarifications for members of the public on the true facts regarding the line item in the Supplementary budget. This was contained in a press statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga. \n",
      "According to the presidential Adviser, President Bola Tinubu’s administration respects the views of Nigerians on all matters of public concern and therefore considers it very imperative to clear any misconception and misunderstanding of the issues.\n",
      "Bayo Onanuga stated that what was named as Presidential Yacht in the budget is an Operational Naval boat with specialized security gadgets suitable for high profile operational inspection and not for the use of the President.\n",
      "“The naval boat is designated a “presidential yacht” by way of nomenclature because of the high level security features”, he stated. \n",
      "Bayo Onanuga also revealed that the said Naval boat was ordered by the navy under the previous administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and President Tinubu in line with his belief that government is a continuum and having inherited both assets and liabilities of past administrations decided to conclude the acquisition.\n",
      "Mr. Onanuga also stated that the payment request for the boat was part of the committed obligation submitted by the office of the Chief of Naval Staff to the Ministry of Defence. The total of the submitted requests according to him was in excess of N200 billion out which N62 billion was approved by the President.\n",
      "“President Tinubu is focused on securing our country and territorial waters. The Federal Government under his leadership is investing more resources to enhance greater economic output from our oil and gas, marine and blue economy”, Onanuga continued.\n",
      "“In President Tinubu, we have a leader who understands the economic challenges being faced by the masses. His administration is working very hard to confront and surmount those challenges. Nigerians will soon get the benefits of the ongoing reforms that will certainly lead to a buoyant and improved quality of life for all citizens”, he concluded.\n",

      "Emotions are funny. They propel us and they hold us back. They polarize us and they unite us. They confuse us and they make things crystal clear.\n",
      "Many believe the best performers are those devoid of emotion, but I think they just understand what emotion to indulge in given the task at hand. Nigerians are very emotional. We are passionate about sports, family, politics and so on. \n",
      "This passion has seen us support causes and ventures closely and with great intensity. However, because most do not support their passions with adequate information and understanding of the larger vision, being easily discouraged is sadly one of our enduring traits. Unfortunately, endurance is a key trait we need to get Nigeria through its current predicament and to the Promise Land.\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29th, 2023. According to an online calculator, that day was 22,885 days since the British gave Nigeria her independence on October 1st, 1960, and 8,766 days since the return to democracy on May 29th, 1999. He is yet to clock 85 days in office as at the time I am typing this article but there are certain people who want you to believe he has failed already.\n",
      "Yes, opinions are free but what makes it particularly dangerous for such thoughts to be left unanswered is the fact that there are certain elements in our society that are ready to use any excuse to foment disharmony. We must give our people any understanding of what the President has been doing since he took office and the immediate, mid- and long-term consequences of his actions.\n",
      "If a patient presents with Multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of 2 or more long-term health conditions), the best way for a doctor to move forward is to understand the issues, acknowledge the challenges and communicate to the patient the uncertainty of the net benefits of the multiple medications and procedures that will have to be done.\n",
      "In cases like this, there is not one best solution because while one medication might be curing one illness, it might be exasperating another. The doctors and the patient must agree on the road map to good health, knowing that there will be painful lows and sweet highs in the undulating path to success. For instance, the loss of hair during chemotherapy should never come to the patient as either a surprise or a sign of further failing health but should be expected as a sign that work is ongoing. Communication is vital.\n",
      "The long analogy above can be used to describe where President Tinubu and Nigeria find themselves today. The path to economic prosperity, unity and peace was always going to be painful and arduous. There is no magic to success. And, on his part, “Doctor” (President) Tinubu has told the nation just how “sick” (economically crippled) his “patient” (Nigeria) is.\n",
      "Below is a portion of the speech the President gave on July 31st, 2023, 63 days after he took office:\n",
      "“Our economy is going through a tough patch and you are being hurt by it. The cost of fuel has gone up. Food and other prices have followed it. Households and businesses struggle. Things seem anxious and uncertain. I understand the hardship you face. I wish there were other ways. But there is not. If there were, I would have taken that route as I came here to help not hurt the people and nation that I love.”\n",
      "This President understands what the everyday Nigerian is going through. That is why he ran for office. On July 6th, the President signed four different Executive Orders. They included the one that suspends the 2023 Finance Act deferring the date of its commencement from May 28, 2023 to September 1,2023, the Customs Excise Tariffs Amendment Order 2023, as well as the imposition of 5% Excise Tax on Telecommunication Services, amongst others. This was done to create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive by reducing the existence of multiple taxes.\n",
      "On August 8th, President Tinubu inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms. The committee was set up four weeks prior and is chaired by former Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), Taiwo Oyedele.\n",
      "The committee has experts from both the private and public sectors as members. While directing all government MDAs to give the committee their maximum cooperation, the President said, “Within the scope of this mandate, the Committee shall have as its objective the advancement of viable and cost effective solutions to issues such as the multiplicity of revenue collection agencies, the high cost of revenue administration, the excessive burden of compliance on ordinary taxpayers, the lack of effective coordination between fiscal and other economic policies within and across levels of government and poor accountability in the utilisation of tax revenues.\n",
      "“Our target is to improve Nigeria’s revenue profile while making the business environment more conducive and internationally competitive. Our aim is to transform the tax system to support sustainable development, while, at the same time, achieving a minimum of 18% Tax to GDP ratio within the next three years.”\n",
      "Currently, Nigeria has a 10.86% Tax to GDP ratio making it one of the countries with the lowest tax collection rates in the world. Seeking to grow this by 80% in 3 years is a sign that the President is bullish about Nigeria and deserves support and commendation.\n",
      "Strengthening the manufacturing sector is vital if our economic and job creation goals must be met. To achieve this, President Tinubu has announced that, between July 2023 and March 2024, 75 enterprises “with great potential to kick-start a sustainable economic growth” will be selected and supported with N1 Billion credit at 9% per annum with maximum of 60 months repayment for long term loans and 12 months for working capital.\n",
      "Also, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector will be energized with N125 billion within the same time frame.\n",
      "On August 17th, it was announced that the Federal Government had approved N5 billion for each state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to enable them to procure food items for distribution to the poor in their respective states. This was in addition to the delivery of five trucks of grains to each state to support the drive to moderate prices. The government is also planning to provide are also providing 225,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer, seedlings and other inputs to farmers all to ensure food security.\n",
      "He has made swift changes to those in charge of our fiscal and monetary policies, and removed the inefficient fuel subsidy that has forced the country into great debt. In July, the three tiers of government had N1.959 trillion to share. This is nearly triple the N786.161 billion shared in June and more than triple the N655.93 billion in May. The Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) had adopted N436.38 per dollar as exchange rate for the calculation of the forex component of collected revenues for June 2023 and that had gone up to about N750 per dollar at the time.\n",
      "Only N907 billion was distributed among the three tiers of government, while N790 billion was saved, and the rest used for statutory deductions.\n",
      "The President also approved the Infrastructure Support Fund for the States. This is designed to enable the States “to intervene and invest in the critical areas of Transportation, including farm-to-market road improvements; Agriculture, encompassing livestock and ranching solutions; Health, with a focus on basic healthcare; Education, especially basic education; Power and Water Resources, that will improve economic competitiveness, create jobs and deliver economic prosperity for Nigerians.”\n",
      "These are all happening as the President has spent the first 100 days of his administration redefining democracy and demystifying the Presidency. So far, he has received visits from various ethnic groups, many of them minorities that have special requests. He has engaged with various sectors vital to the socio-economic stability of the country. Our war on insecurity has taken a refreshing approach as the new service chiefs have gotten their marching orders.\n",
      "The state governors are in talks with the Organised Labour on the new minimum wage, even as each one of them has been given N5 billion and five trucks of grains to help alleviate the pains brought on by the removal of fuel subsidy.\n",
      "Scarcity is the mother of innovation, hence there is now a realization that we can use alternative fuels to power our economy. To this end, the President approved the establishment of the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas Initiative (PCNGI). The move is poised to revolutionise the transportation landscape in the country, targeting over 11,500 new Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-enabled vehicles and 55,000 CNG conversion kits for existing Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)-dependent vehicles. The initiative comprises of a Comprehensive Adoption Strategy, to include Empowering Workshops Programme, Local Assembly and Job Creation.\n",
      "To also prepare Nigeria for the economy of today and the future, 10 new ministries have been created or others modified to ensure optimum delivery of service to the people. They include: Marine and Blue Economy; Art, Culture and the Creative Economy; Health and Social Welfare; Aviation and Aerospace Development amongst others.\n",
      "The road to economic recovery is an intricate process that demands careful consideration and collaboration. President Tinubu recognizes this and has reiterated the need for a collective effort in overcoming the challenges faced by Nigeria.\n",
      "While painful adjustments may be necessary, the long-term gains must be prioritized. Investing in infrastructure, diversifying the economy, and promoting job creation are among the strategies to foster growth and stabilize the nation’s financial health.\n",
      "Emotions have a profound impact on our lives, and in Nigeria, they hold significant sway over our actions and beliefs. Developing a balanced approach that combines our passionate nature with informed understanding is key to overcoming challenges.\n",
      "President Tinubu’s tenure may be in its early stages, but it is essential to avoid premature judgments and give due time for effective policies to take root. Communication, empathy, and endurance are crucial elements as Nigeria navigates its path to a promising future. By embracing these factors and engaging in constructive dialogue, we can build a prosperous and united nation.\n",

      "The former Lagos governor, who received the country’s highest civilian honour of GCFR earlier on Thursday, sent the crowd into a frenzy with an appearance alongside the Vice President-Elect, Senator Kashim Shettima, and other key government officials including Speaker Gbajabiamila, Governor Yahaya Bello, FCT Minister of State Hajia Ramatu, Hon James Faleke, and others.\n",
      "According to the organizers, the concert was staged to offer young Nigerians who contributed to the triumph of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu an opportunity to come together to celebrate his historic victory, while also joining forces with young Nigerians of different political persuasions who are encouraged to move on from the divisiveness of the election and play their parts as citizens in ensuring the success of the next administration.\n",

      "The concert became the number one trending topic in the entire country, a remarkable development obvious in its apex position on the trend charts of leading social media platforms such as Twitter. For many, it raised the standards for youth entertainment in the country given its perfect execution from the stage to the lineup of artists, media coverage, food and drinks, accommodation offered to attendees from different parts of the country, and other goodies.\n",
      "Others claimed that it gave an inkling of what is to come in the Tinubu-administration as many young Nigerians got their hopes renewed at the event by winning brand new cars (6), smartphones (over 100), power banks (over 5000) and other prizes handed out as souvenirs and during a raffle draw.\n",
      "People living with disabilities also got brand new wheelchairs and walking aids courtesy of the central organizing committee led by Seyi Tinubu.\n",

      "The nation’s next first son led the initiative for the event and he was supported by prominent youth figures such as Dada Olusegun who yet again proved his mettle at the event by coordinating execution efforts as the Committee’s Secretary. He also personally led thousands of youths to the event, further underscoring his strength as a young politician.\n",
      "With days to another democratic transition of power in the country, the excitement level has been revved up by the event and young Nigerians are expressing greater optimism about the capacity and commitment of the next president Bola Tinubu to enable their success and complete the restoration of the country’s glory.\n",

      " \n",
      "Contractors engaged by Lagos State Government to handle the construction of 1,188-unit LagosHOMS in Sangotedo area of Eti Osa now have a final completion date to deliver the project.\n",
      "After defaulting previous deadlines, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu mandated the contractors to finish up the 744 flats being developed in Scheme 1 of the housing project by the end of next month (October).\n",
      "The Governor, on Friday, handed down the new deadline when he inspected the housing project to assess the pace of construction work.\n",
      "The project, sited on 16.9 hectares, took off in 2012. It was revived by the Sanwo-Olu administration. The first scheme of the project has 62 blocks of 12 flats each, while the second scheme has 32 blocks of 444 flats.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu, who was accompanied on the inspection by members of the State’s cabinet had a one-on-one engagement with the contractors during which he expressed his displeasure over the slow work on the project.\n",
      "The Governor issued a stern warning to those culpable in defaulting the deadlines, saying he would no longer tolerate tardiness in the work. Erring contractors, the Governor threatened, would have their deals terminated should there be no progress in the next seven days.\n",
      "He said: “We have come on an inspection of this massive construction site that is divided into two phases. The level of work on Phase One is over 90 percent, but this is not the same in the second phase. In the next six weeks, we will be handing over the 744 units in Phase 1 of the project and all contractors working on it must complete their work.\n",
      "“I commend all contractors that have worked tirelessly to push through; I understand this has been a very difficult project. We have been working night and day, trying to deliver the project. We want to be fair to every contractor and we appreciate those who have shown real resilience and commitment.\n",
      "“I use this opportunity to give a stern warning to erring contractors slowing down the project. It doesn’t matter who you know, I am not going to tolerate this tardiness any longer. I will give you one week to scale up work on the project. If there is no appreciable improvement, not only are we going to terminate those erring contracts, we will also prosecute them.”\n",
      "The Governor pointed out that there was no reason for the contractors to delay the project and postpone deadlines, stressing that the State Government had fulfilled financial obligations in the contract.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu directed officials of the Ministry of Housing and Ministry of Works and Infrastructure to monitor the contractors and submit progress reports on the project. He said the report would determine whether the contractors would be considered again by the State Government for other projects.\n",
      "Sanwo-Olu, at the meeting, called out the defaulters, and said: “I have not come here to turn you away, but to make peace and restitution. For those contractors still working, we will wait for another four more weeks for extensive clean-up before we finally commission the project.”\n",
      "The Governor also set a nine-month deadline for the completion of the project’s Scheme Two, urging those handling the work to finish up before June, 2022.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fresh details on the agitation against President of the Senate, Godswill Akpabio emerged over the weekend with the revelation that the disaffection on committee appointments was only diversionary.\n",
      "The real angst of the group of senators, it was reliably gathered, is the suspicion of the incapacity of the Senate President to checkmate what some northern senators are calling the Yorubanisation of the country’s financial system and economy. \n",
      "Besides the alleged perception of Akpabio’s lack of capacity to checkmate the purported domination of the Yoruba ethnic nationalities in the financial ecosystem, is also his alleged refusal to deal with some powerful interest groups, particularly some petrol importers and the electricity distribution companies on some proposed financial deals bordering on 40 percent electricity tariff hike and payment of outstanding money to fuel importers.\n",
      "Newspaper publications had last weekend alleged a plot by some unnamed senators against Akpabio alleging lopsided distribution of Grade A committees mainly in favour of his supporters and to the discrimination of those who opposed him during the leadership contest.\n",
      "While it was gathered that the allegation may have some substance, it has, however, emerged that some rivals of the Senate President may have regrouped using as a reason, his apparent failure to check the lopsided appointments by the President in favour of the Yoruba, especially in the financial sector.\n",
      "Among the senators, who are alleged to have regrouped with a mission of standing up to Senator Akpabio are some former governors drawn from the North and at least one from the South-South.\n",
      "The group has now formally come out by presenting Senator Elisha Abbo, APC, Adamawa North as the face of the group.\n",
      "Senator Abbo, in newspaper interviews at the weekend, accused Akpabio of marginalising his rivals in the leadership contest and their supporters in the distribution of the committee positions.\n",
      "However, sources within the Abbo group have now revealed that the angst of the group was far more and go beyond the Senate President.\n",
      "“The main issue is our fear that Akpabio cannot check this Yorubanisation of the financial system that is going on now,” a source within the group revealed at the weekend.\n",
      "The source who spoke on the basis of confidentiality alluded to the appointments at the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Customs, among others that have recently been infused with Yoruba leadership. The control of the agencies is besides the appointment of Yoruba Ministers in the financial sector and the blue economy.\n",
      "“Yes, the reason why you can see that Northerners are mostly involved is that most of those being removed and replaced with Yoruba are northerners,” the source further revealed.\n",
      "It was further gathered that the aim of the senators is to enthrone a senate president the group believes can checkmate President Bola Tinubu.\n",
      "Besides the appointments, the group is also said to be working on behalf of some interest groups in the economy who believe that they were shortchanged after reaching agreements with the president and Akpabio on the payment of subsidy to the petrol importers.\n",
      "It was gathered that an arrangement had been reached with the presidency that funds generated from the removal of fuel subsidy would be used to settle petrol importers within the first two months of the removal of subsidy. The fund amounting to N2 trillion has, however, not been so used but rather pushed to palliatives intervention.\n",
      "Another interest group said to have infiltrated the ranks of the dissident senators were some Electricity Distribution companies who were said to have also reached an agreement with the presidency and Akpabio for an upward review of 40 percent of tariff. That agreement was, however, discountenanced on the Senate floor by Akpabio.\n",
      "Just like those being pushed out in the appointments in the financial sector, Northern business interest groups, are believed to be more affected by the decision not to pay the petrol importers.\n",

      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and President of the United Arab Emirates, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on Monday in Abu Dhabi, have finalized a historic agreement, which has resulted in the immediate cessation of the visa ban placed on Nigerian travelers.\n",
      "Furthermore, by this historic agreement, both Etihad Airlines and Emirates Airlines are to immediately resume flight schedules into and out of Nigeria, without any further delay. \n",
      "As negotiated between the two Heads of State, this immediate restoration of flight activity, through these two airlines and between the two countries, does not involve any immediate payment by the Nigerian government.\n",
      "In recognition of President Tinubu’s economic development diplomacy drive and proposals today presented by President Tinubu to his counterpart, an agreed framework has been established, which will involve several billions of U.S. dollars worth of new investments into the Nigerian economy across multiple sectors, including defense, agriculture and others, by the investment arms of the Government of the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "Additionally, President Tinubu is pleased to have successfully negotiated a joint, new foreign exchange liquidity programme between the two Governments, which will be announced in detail in the coming weeks.\n",
      "In conclusion, the President wishes to commend the UAE President, Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for his unalloyed friendship and his determined effort to join hands with him to fully normalize and reset to excellence, the standard of relations between the two important countries.\n",

      "Emotions are funny. They propel us and they hold us back. They polarize us and they unite us. They confuse us and they make things crystal clear.\n",
      "Many believe the best performers are those devoid of emotion, but I think they just understand what emotion to indulge in given the task at hand. Nigerians are very emotional. We are passionate about sports, family, politics and so on. \n",
      "This passion has seen us support causes and ventures closely and with great intensity. However, because most do not support their passions with adequate information and understanding of the larger vision, being easily discouraged is sadly one of our enduring traits. Unfortunately, endurance is a key trait we need to get Nigeria through its current predicament and to the Promise Land.\n",
      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29th, 2023. According to an online calculator, that day was 22,885 days since the British gave Nigeria her independence on October 1st, 1960, and 8,766 days since the return to democracy on May 29th, 1999. He is yet to clock 85 days in office as at the time I am typing this article but there are certain people who want you to believe he has failed already.\n",
      "Yes, opinions are free but what makes it particularly dangerous for such thoughts to be left unanswered is the fact that there are certain elements in our society that are ready to use any excuse to foment disharmony. We must give our people any understanding of what the President has been doing since he took office and the immediate, mid- and long-term consequences of his actions.\n",
      "If a patient presents with Multimorbidity (i.e., the presence of 2 or more long-term health conditions), the best way for a doctor to move forward is to understand the issues, acknowledge the challenges and communicate to the patient the uncertainty of the net benefits of the multiple medications and procedures that will have to be done.\n",
      "In cases like this, there is not one best solution because while one medication might be curing one illness, it might be exasperating another. The doctors and the patient must agree on the road map to good health, knowing that there will be painful lows and sweet highs in the undulating path to success. For instance, the loss of hair during chemotherapy should never come to the patient as either a surprise or a sign of further failing health but should be expected as a sign that work is ongoing. Communication is vital.\n",
      "The long analogy above can be used to describe where President Tinubu and Nigeria find themselves today. The path to economic prosperity, unity and peace was always going to be painful and arduous. There is no magic to success. And, on his part, “Doctor” (President) Tinubu has told the nation just how “sick” (economically crippled) his “patient” (Nigeria) is.\n",
      "Below is a portion of the speech the President gave on July 31st, 2023, 63 days after he took office:\n",
      "“Our economy is going through a tough patch and you are being hurt by it. The cost of fuel has gone up. Food and other prices have followed it. Households and businesses struggle. Things seem anxious and uncertain. I understand the hardship you face. I wish there were other ways. But there is not. If there were, I would have taken that route as I came here to help not hurt the people and nation that I love.”\n",
      "This President understands what the everyday Nigerian is going through. That is why he ran for office. On July 6th, the President signed four different Executive Orders. They included the one that suspends the 2023 Finance Act deferring the date of its commencement from May 28, 2023 to September 1,2023, the Customs Excise Tariffs Amendment Order 2023, as well as the imposition of 5% Excise Tax on Telecommunication Services, amongst others. This was done to create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive by reducing the existence of multiple taxes.\n",
      "On August 8th, President Tinubu inaugurated the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms. The committee was set up four weeks prior and is chaired by former Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC), Taiwo Oyedele.\n",
      "The committee has experts from both the private and public sectors as members. While directing all government MDAs to give the committee their maximum cooperation, the President said, “Within the scope of this mandate, the Committee shall have as its objective the advancement of viable and cost effective solutions to issues such as the multiplicity of revenue collection agencies, the high cost of revenue administration, the excessive burden of compliance on ordinary taxpayers, the lack of effective coordination between fiscal and other economic policies within and across levels of government and poor accountability in the utilisation of tax revenues.\n",
      "“Our target is to improve Nigeria’s revenue profile while making the business environment more conducive and internationally competitive. Our aim is to transform the tax system to support sustainable development, while, at the same time, achieving a minimum of 18% Tax to GDP ratio within the next three years.”\n",
      "Currently, Nigeria has a 10.86% Tax to GDP ratio making it one of the countries with the lowest tax collection rates in the world. Seeking to grow this by 80% in 3 years is a sign that the President is bullish about Nigeria and deserves support and commendation.\n",
      "Strengthening the manufacturing sector is vital if our economic and job creation goals must be met. To achieve this, President Tinubu has announced that, between July 2023 and March 2024, 75 enterprises “with great potential to kick-start a sustainable economic growth” will be selected and supported with N1 Billion credit at 9% per annum with maximum of 60 months repayment for long term loans and 12 months for working capital.\n",
      "Also, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector will be energized with N125 billion within the same time frame.\n",
      "On August 17th, it was announced that the Federal Government had approved N5 billion for each state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to enable them to procure food items for distribution to the poor in their respective states. This was in addition to the delivery of five trucks of grains to each state to support the drive to moderate prices. The government is also planning to provide are also providing 225,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer, seedlings and other inputs to farmers all to ensure food security.\n",
      "He has made swift changes to those in charge of our fiscal and monetary policies, and removed the inefficient fuel subsidy that has forced the country into great debt. In July, the three tiers of government had N1.959 trillion to share. This is nearly triple the N786.161 billion shared in June and more than triple the N655.93 billion in May. The Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) had adopted N436.38 per dollar as exchange rate for the calculation of the forex component of collected revenues for June 2023 and that had gone up to about N750 per dollar at the time.\n",
      "Only N907 billion was distributed among the three tiers of government, while N790 billion was saved, and the rest used for statutory deductions.\n",
      "The President also approved the Infrastructure Support Fund for the States. This is designed to enable the States “to intervene and invest in the critical areas of Transportation, including farm-to-market road improvements; Agriculture, encompassing livestock and ranching solutions; Health, with a focus on basic healthcare; Education, especially basic education; Power and Water Resources, that will improve economic competitiveness, create jobs and deliver economic prosperity for Nigerians.”\n",
      "These are all happening as the President has spent the first 100 days of his administration redefining democracy and demystifying the Presidency. So far, he has received visits from various ethnic groups, many of them minorities that have special requests. He has engaged with various sectors vital to the socio-economic stability of the country. Our war on insecurity has taken a refreshing approach as the new service chiefs have gotten their marching orders.\n",
      "The state governors are in talks with the Organised Labour on the new minimum wage, even as each one of them has been given N5 billion and five trucks of grains to help alleviate the pains brought on by the removal of fuel subsidy.\n",
      "Scarcity is the mother of innovation, hence there is now a realization that we can use alternative fuels to power our economy. To this end, the President approved the establishment of the Presidential Compressed Natural Gas Initiative (PCNGI). The move is poised to revolutionise the transportation landscape in the country, targeting over 11,500 new Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-enabled vehicles and 55,000 CNG conversion kits for existing Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)-dependent vehicles. The initiative comprises of a Comprehensive Adoption Strategy, to include Empowering Workshops Programme, Local Assembly and Job Creation.\n",
      "To also prepare Nigeria for the economy of today and the future, 10 new ministries have been created or others modified to ensure optimum delivery of service to the people. They include: Marine and Blue Economy; Art, Culture and the Creative Economy; Health and Social Welfare; Aviation and Aerospace Development amongst others.\n",
      "The road to economic recovery is an intricate process that demands careful consideration and collaboration. President Tinubu recognizes this and has reiterated the need for a collective effort in overcoming the challenges faced by Nigeria.\n",
      "While painful adjustments may be necessary, the long-term gains must be prioritized. Investing in infrastructure, diversifying the economy, and promoting job creation are among the strategies to foster growth and stabilize the nation’s financial health.\n",
      "Emotions have a profound impact on our lives, and in Nigeria, they hold significant sway over our actions and beliefs. Developing a balanced approach that combines our passionate nature with informed understanding is key to overcoming challenges.\n",
      "President Tinubu’s tenure may be in its early stages, but it is essential to avoid premature judgments and give due time for effective policies to take root. Communication, empathy, and endurance are crucial elements as Nigeria navigates its path to a promising future. By embracing these factors and engaging in constructive dialogue, we can build a prosperous and united nation.\n",

      "By Temitope Ajayi\n",
      "The number of delegates from Nigeria attending the ongoing Climate Summit in Dubai otherwise called COP28 has generated a lot of controversies and strong social media conversations in the last 24 hours. It is important to set the record straight and provide some clarity. To begin with, the Summit is tagged COP which means Convention of Parties. The ongoing Summit in Dubai with over 97,000 delegates from more than 100 countries around the world is the 28th in the series since the issue of climate change and action took preeminent stage in global affairs. COP27 took place at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt last year. \n",
      "When the world comes together to take actions on achieving a common goal and proffer collective solutions to a nagging global concern, there are parties involved from government, private sector, civil society, media and multilateral institutions. The people coming together to advance their different agenda and interests from governments, businesses and civil societies are the parties to the convention who represent various shades of opinions and pushing for various mitigating actions.\n",
      "In Nigeria like so many other countries, interested parties comprising government officials from both the Federal and sub-national governments, business leaders, environmentalists, climate activists and journalists are present in Dubai. Also participating  are agencies of government such as the NNPC and its subsidiaries, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, NIMASA,   NDDC. Many youth organisations from Nigeria especially from the Northern and Niger-Delta regions whose lives and livelihoods are most impacted by desert encroachment and hydrocarbon activities are also represented. The President of Ijaw Youth Council, Jonathan Lokpobiri, leads a pan-Ijaw delegation of more than 15 people who registered as parties from Nigeria. Among delegates from Nigeria are also over 20 journalists from various media houses.\n",
      "Their participation is very important. It is not for jamboree as it is being mischievously represented on social media.\n",
      "It is important to state here that delegates from all countries whether from government, private sector, media and civil society groups attend COP summits and conferences as parties and the number of attendees are registered against their countries of origin. This does not mean that they are sponsored or funded by the government. It must be said also that the fact that people registered to attend a conference does not also mean everyone that registered are physically present. \n",
      "As the biggest country in Africa, biggest economy and one with a bigger stake on climate action as a country with huge extractive economy, it is a no-brainer that delegates from Nigeria will be more than any other country in Africa. \n",
      "Among the delegates from Nigeria are UBA Chairman, Tony Elumelu, Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA group, and other billionaires whose businesses are promoting sustainability and climate actions through their philanthropies. These businessmen and women and their staff who came with them to promote their own business interests are part of the 1,411 delegates  from Nigeria.  Their trip to Dubai is not funded by the Federal Government. \n",
      "United Nations Climate summit, by its very nature, commands attendance of big names from across the world – statesmen and women, politicians, lawmakers, corporate titans,  journalists and activists, etc who promote big global agenda. So, people attend the summit for many reasons. And because climate issue is the biggest global issue of the moment, it is not surprising that over 97,000 people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, King Charles of United Kingdom, Prime Minister of Netherlands, Mark Rutte, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, US Special Envoy on Climate Change and former Secretary of State, John Kerry, President Bola Tinubu, United Nations Secretary General, Antonio  Guterres, World Bank President, Ajay Banga, International Monetary Fund President, Kristalina Georgieva, World Trade Organisation Director General, Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Africa Development Bank President, Akinwumi Adesina, former US Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize Winner, Al Gore and almost 100 Heads of States and Governments converged on Dubai for COP28. It is the first of its kind in the history of the summit because of the importance of climate change to global well-being.\n",
      "After the opening and national statements by Heads of States which began from November 30 when the summit opened and up until Saturday December 2, 2023, the real work of COP28 which are the technical sessions and negotiations, financing, etc will begin from Monday, December 4 till December 12 where agreements will be reached on many proposals for consideration and ratification by the parties.\n",
      "Those with sufficient understanding and knowledge on climate matters know that issues around the subject have  layers and multiplicity of factors that require experts from various fields. There are lined-up technical sessions on financing climate actions at sub-national levels, regions and local governments. State Governors from Nigeria such as Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, Umo Eno of Akwa-Ibom have been really busy with their officials at COP28, making presentations, speaking at panel sessions and pitching some of their sustainability projects to development partners and investors. \n",
      "Multifaceted stakeholders from different countries including Nigeria are on ground in Dubai because they don’t want decisions that will affect them to be taken without pushing their own agenda. It is the reason delegates from China and Brazil are over 3000 respectively. China is one of the world biggest polluters and Brazil is at the centre of global climate debate with her Amazon rainforest. These two countries know important decisions that will affect them will be taken and they have to move everything to be fully on ground and ensure they are fully represented by their best brains at every level of discussion and negotiation. \n",
      "Like former President Muhammadu Buhari and other African leaders who demanded fair deal and climate justice for Africa at previous UN Climate summits, President Tinubu is leading the charge at COP28 on behalf of Nigeria and the rest of the continent, demanding from the West that any climate decision and action must be fair and just to Africa and Nigeria in particular, especially the debate around energy transition. President Tinubu has been unequivocal in his position that Africa that is battling problems of poverty, security and struggling to provide education and healthcare to her people can not be told to abandon its major source of income which is mostly from extractive industries without the West providing the funding and investment in alternative and clean energy sources. President Tinubu and other officials on the Federal government delegation are in Dubai for serious business not jamboree. Our President has been very busy representing our country well. Since Thursday morning when he arrived Dubai, President Tinubu has spent not less than 18hours daily in attending very important sessions, pushing our national agenda whilst holding bilateral and business meetings on the sidelines. \n",

      "President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is currently in the United Arab Emirates alongside other world leaders for the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) otherwise known as COP28. \n",
      "Each year, the COP brings together world leaders, scientists and activists to discuss and make progress on global climate action. The goals of these annual gatherings include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing climate adaptation and resilience, and mobilizing finance for climate action. Reducing greenhouse emissions entails reducing use of fossil fuel incrementally. But Nigeria is rich in fossil fuel and depends heavily on proceeds from sale of crude oil to finance its growth.\n",
      "The above scenario seems like a paradox because it brings us to the question of what exactly is Nigeria seeking to achieve in these climate summits whose ultimate goal is to save the planet by cutting back on use of fossil fuel as source of energy. The answers are quite straightforward. Nigeria wants to ensure there is CLIMATE CHANGE EQUITY!\n",
      "This is basically the message Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, then presidential candidate of the APC sought to convey in October 2022 at the Arewa House when, in response to a question on Climate Change, perfectly captured the dilemma faced by many poor resource-rich developing nations like Nigeria. Candidate Tinubu at that time famously said, “climate change is a question of how do you prevent a church rat from eating a poisoned holy communion”.\n",
      "Even though President Tinubu’s analogy was controversy, largely due to many noisy ignorant commentators, he couldn’t have captured the situation more succinctly. The church rat signifies poor resource-rich nations like Nigeria while the poisoned holy communion signifies crude oil, which despite being a source of needed revenue for these nations, are the main contributors to climate change hence its description as a “blessed curse”.\n",
      "The climate change discussions/negotiations have always ran into troubled waters whenever it comes to actual commitments by countries to cut back on the exploitation of fossil fuels. The climate change equity being championed by developing countries who are also rich in fossil fuel such as Nigeria, is simply the idea that all countries should contribute to tackling climate change in proportion to their ability to do so.\n",
      "This means that developed countries, which have emitted the majority of greenhouse gases in the past and have the greatest capacity to address climate change, should take on a greater share of the burden of reducing emissions and providing financial support to developing countries. Climate change equity as canvassed by poor countries also requires developed countries to provide financial support to help poorer nations adapt to the impacts of climate change and transition to low-carbon economies.\n",
      "Developing countries such as Nigeria argue that they have contributed far less to the problem of climate change and should not be expected to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions without financial assistance. So, when you look at these backdrops you can begin to understand how important these climate change summits are to a country like Nigeria. Our voice needs to be heard at the negotiating table.\n",
      "Luckily, Nigeria is led at this point in time by a President Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has consistently shown great understanding of the fluid nature of the Climate Change discussion as it concerns Nigeria’s strategic interest. President Tinubu is not against reducing greenhouse emissions and faster transition to low carbon energy sources. In fact, during the campaigns and after assumption of office, President Tinubu has always emphasised on the need for Nigeria to exploit its gas resources, which is a cleaner source of energy.\n",
      "President Tinubu pre-election called on the West to spare some credit to finance pipelines from Nigeria to Europe that can transport gas to them. Post-election, President Bola Tinubu has been relentless in his pursuit of concrete investment in gas production as well as building of pipeline infrastructure for gas export to Europe. In the past four months, he has met the German Chancellor four times at various fora and discussions between the two leaders usually involve gas, gas and gas.\n",
      "COP28 therefore provides a valuable platform for President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reiterate Nigeria’s self-imposed net zero carbon emission targets as well as to let the world know about efforts Nigeria is making to transition to cleaner energy sources such as the removal of fuel subsidy, which is indirectly unlocking opportunities for increased CNG utilisation and investments. COP28 most importantly is providing Nigeria and President Bola Tinubu a platform to shop for investments that will aid these transitions.\n",
      "Already President Bola Tinubu on the sidelines of the ongoing summit, has signed a bilateral agreement with the German government to accelerate the implementation of the 2019 Siemens deal and the realisation of the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) aimed at ramping up the wheeling capacity of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to 12,000mw in the next 18 months. An improved power generation through the use of cleaner gas-fired power plants will drastically reduce Nigeria’s greenhouse gas emissions emanating from use of petrol/diesel generators as alternative power sources.\n",
      "Nigeria, as a proverbial church rat must therefore milk the ongoing COP28 to the fullest as we strive to balance economic growth and the survival of our dear planet.\n",

      "RE:10TH NASS: Onuoha Not Eligible to Contest Speaker or Deputy Speaker Position– CSO \n",
      "\n",
      "The attention of the Media Office of Rt.Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha,Member representing Okigwe North Federal Constituency of Imo State and candidate for Speaker in the 10th House of Representatives,has been drawn to a publication in the online edition of the Leadership Newspaper of Sunday,May 28,2023,which appeared under the immediate headline above allegedly authored by one Igho Oyoyo and purpotedly inspired by a Press Conference claimed to have been held in Abuja by a faceless group that goes by the name and style,”Legislative Watch Unit” of the Civil Society Central Coordinating Council (CSCCC).\n",
      "While we would not have bothered to waste a drop of ink on the tissue of falsehoods and misrepresentations the said piece spunned in its obviously-sponsored attempt to de-market our principal and to put a wedge in the rising profile of the only woman in the race for a Presiding Officer’s position in the leadership configuration of the entire emerging 10th National Assembly,we are, however,concerned that,if that kind of ill-written and badly researched hogwash published under the paid instigation of a fellow lawmaker ,who calls himself “a brother”,but is, actually,a desperado seeking by all means, fair and foul, to win a Presiding Officer’s position in the House of Representatives ,is allowed to go unchallenged ,chances are that there are some gullible members of society who may be wont to swallow the negative narratives wickedly portrayed in that highly-degrading piece as truths or even half truths!\n",
      "For the avoidance of doubt,Rt Hon.Miriam Odinaka Onuoha,Member representing Okigwe / Onuimo and Isiala Mbano(otherwise known as Okigwe North) Federal Constituency and Chairman, Committee on Disabilities of the House of Representatives, remains a lawmaker who possesses the competence, experience, character,the qualifications,the leadership skills and popularity among her colleagues to aspire to any leadership positions at not only the House of Representatives,but anywhere else across the land. It is, therefore,wicked and uncharitable, to the former Regional Banker and highly experienced and cerebral public and private sector player,to say the least, for anyone to suggest that,”…by the extant House Rules Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha does not qualify to run for any leadership positions in the House of Representatives”.We wonder what ” extant rules” Barr. Anderson Achilike( if he ever exists) and his ill-advised cohorts on this ignoble path of perdition are talking about in their sponsored online piece in the Leadership Newspaper of Sunday,28th May.\n",
      "We condemn that piece in its entirety and wish to hastily add that,by virtue of Order 2, Rule 3(a) of the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives, Nigeria ( 9th Edition, Ordered to be Printed 23rd March 2016),which states,inter alia,” A Member-elect, addressing the Clerk,shall propose another Member-elect *with experience* as member of the National Assembly to be Speaker and shall move that such Member-elect,’Do take the Chair as Speaker of the House of Representatives’ ” the Rt.Hon.Miriam Odinaka Onuoha is qualified to run for the position she is seeking at the National Assembly. The aforequoted rule is the Ranking Rule for lawmakers by virtue of which all returning lawmakers qualify to run for the position of Speaker being , usually, referred to as Primus Interperes!( First Among Equals)\n",
      "And so we continue to wonder who is afraid of the rising profile of Rt. Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha,the Princess of the 9th Assembly who has continued to dazzle all National Assembly watchers and political pundits since she made her belated,but triumphant entry into the National Assembly on the 27th February 2020? After spending 3 good years and 4 solid months within which our star lawmaker has made appreciable general impacts ,as we shall see shortly,is Hon.Benjamin Kalu ,who struggled all the way to return to the House, winning a paltry number of votes for the Party’s then Presidential candidate,H.E.Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and his paid hatched hands saying that he qualifies more than Princess Onuoha for either the Speakership or Deputy Speakership position of the 10th House of Representatives? The question that readily comes to mind is “how?”\n",
      "To drive home the above position,let us attempt to cursorily juxtapose the personalities and achievements in the 9th House of both Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha and Hon. Benjamin Kalu,who is Chairman, House Committee on Media.Both of them are second-term ranking Members of the current House.While Miriam Onuoha, following an INEC- conducted re-run election, was inaugurated into office on the 27th February 2020 as a member of the 9th Assembly, Benjamin Kalu had earlier come on June 11,2019( some 8 months earlier) as a Member of the same 9th Assembly and whatever claims to the contrary he may seek to make,as is widely known of him, will be a his trademark, barefaced lie.\n",
      "As stated earlier,what the above implies is that Hon. Miriam Onuoha has been in the House for 3 years and 4 months. Whatever difference that has made in terms of ranking between the two lawmakers cannot only a product of Kalu’s unsettled and anxious imagination! One wonders what a few months’ difference in coming to the 9th House has made between the two Members that would make Hon. Kalu suggest through his media ilk and pawns that Hon. Onuoha does not qualify to run for the leadership of the 10th House “because she has only been in the 9th House for a little over two years”. This lie from the pit of hell is despite the laudable achievements of Hon. Onuoha within the last three years and four months under review and the glowing credentials she has packed under her leadership pouch over the past years.The whole reasoning stands logic on its head.It sounds rather absurd,and coming from a self- acclaimed lawyer,it remains doubtful if,as in all his previous posturing,he is actually who he claims to be.\n",
      "For Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha,she wants the people to judge her by her competence, experience,character and achievements in and outside the House of Representatives.Her life remains an open book,which anyone can pick up and read;a mirror through which people can from what she has done read what she is capable of doing! She has met all the needed criteria in legislative prowess,in brilliance,in youthful energy and zeal,in political astuteness,in maturity,in gender balancing and equity for the Southeast Zone to present herself to her colleagues for their kind consideration for leadership,yet she remains humble about it all.\n",
      "Hon. Miriam Onuoha has in the 9th Assembly sat for the required 181 days yearly of full legislative session constitutionally required of every National Assembly in line with Chapter 4,Part I(63) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended),which stipulates that:”The Senate and the House of Representatives shall each sit for a period of not less than One Hundred and Eighty-one days in a year.” In spite of the fact that this is not one of the set conditions in the guidelines for electing Presiding Officers of the House,Hon. Onuoha has ,all the same,met it. So,upon what pedestal can anyone fault her candidacy for Speakership or Deputy Speakership?\n",
      "Further more,Hon.Miriam Onuoha is currently the pioneer House Committee Chairman on Disabilities. Her records in the Special Committee,for which she has received several official accolades from both governmental and corporate quarters in high places, are all too-glaring for anyone to ignore. Apart from the above,she has been constantly drawn to many thorny areas of very grave implications and national challenges through which she has in over the last three years in the House proven her leadership mettle.\n",
      "For instance,let us take just a cursory look at the below:\n",
      "She served as ADHOC Committee Chairman on the Alleged Breach of Presidential Directives in the Sack of NSITF Staff by the Hon Minister of Labour and Productivity;\n",
      "-She also served as the Deputy Chairman of the AD HOC Committee on the Relocation of Tank Farms in Residential Places of Ijegun and Others,an interactable, difficult national issue to handle at the time,but which she pulled off with dexterity,using native tart and local diplomatic ideals.\n",
      "Despite resuming a bit late in the 9th Assembly,we must also be reminded that Hon.Miriam Onuoha was also a Legislative Aide to Late Sen. Benjamin Uwajumogu at the 8th Assembly before returning to her native Imo State in the 2019/2020 General and Re- run elections to win the votes that brought her into the 9th Assembly. As “knowledgeable” as our man,Kalu will always claim to be,the importance of such experience as being a Legislative Aide at the National Assembly before venturing into the House as an elected Member,like Governor Tambuwal,Speaker Dogara,Hon.Nkem-Abonta,Toby Okechukwu,among many high- flying national leaders of today’s Nigeria, will forever be lost on the garrulous Spokesperson of the House,amidst his many highfalutin claims! Every former Legislative Aide retains forever some elements of the institutional memory of the legislature. Perhaps,with all due modesty,this explains why Hon. Onuoha has been able to turn in the level of legislative returns she has made in a little over three years against the scorecards of many, including Kalu, that started out before her at the 9th Assembly House of Representatives.\n",
      "Hon. Miriam Onuoha has sponsored several bills, 3 of which were before President Buhari for assent. There are also under her kitty notable impactful motions moved, while yet making strong contributions to issues of topical national importance. As for our traducer-turned brother ,we do not know if he can ever boast of a scorecard of this nature, especially,since he has continued to inform all who care to listen that speaking for the House was too engrossing a job on its own to allow a participation in the business of lawmaking. This inability to multitask,to us ,is where our principal holds a global record as the greatest multitasker we have ever known.Perhaps,one will not be wrong to say that this attribute and ability of doing many things at the same time and doing them well,as well, by Hon . Onuoha is something that comes naturally to her as a mother,which was mastered many years ago in the course of combining child- rearing with corporate and public practices,which will, certainly,be a good attribute to anyone who will eventually become Speaker or his Deputy in the 10th House.\n",
      "Again,let us return to that Leadership Newspaper piece of yesterday, Sunday.Since Hon. Benjamin Kalu has only been in the House also for one tenure like Hon. Miriam Onuoha, what was he trying to insinuate with his sponsored media blitz krieg? Was he trying to insinuate that the South East candidates do not qualify for the Presiding Officers’ positions, especially, against the backdrop that neither he nor anyone from the Zone in the ruling Party that has won a return ticket to the 10th House is a 3rd ,4th or 5th timer like most senior members of the 9th Assembly ?\n",
      "Despite Kalu’s uncharitable posturing and ingratiating manouvring against a Zone and some well-known leaders from the Zone who had assisted him to climb the political ladder in life,we must emphasize here that the Southeast Zone deserves the consideration of lawmakers in our bid to bring in fairness, equity and balancing to a Zone that has been so marginalized and abandoned in the political equation of our dear country over time. There ought to be an attempt at assuaging this perceived marginalisation and the National Assembly leadership is a good way to start. We consider it curious that an Igbo man should insist that he must be pencilled down for whatever that ought to be allotted to the Southeast Zone at the entire National Assembly or else such a position should be moved to another region! What cheek,what arrogance!\n",
      "Hon. Miriam Onuoha has acquired verified qualifications and undisputed certificates as B.Sc ( Hons),Estate Management ,from the University of Lagos;a Masters Degree in Environmental Planning and Protection( MEPP) from the University of Abuja, and a Post Graduate Diploma in Peace Studies & Conflict Resolution from the National Open University of Nigeria. The above are against the claims of our “brother” whose acclaimed qualifications and places from where they have originated are all of questionable nature. Hon. Onuoha was also a committed member of the Petroleum Industry Bill Committee as well as the Constitutional Amendment and Electoral Act ( Amendment ) Bill Committees, respectfully .In all of these positions,as available records would easily show,she proved herself a highly resourceful lawmaker and even,more importantly,a team player. This is a character trait that we have found hard to trace in our so-called brother with whose brotherhood,most Abians will tell you,you do not need an enemy! That is the serial betrayer angling to lead or deputize the leadership of a respectable place like the House of Representatives. Those who doubt this assertion,had better consult his former political benefactors who did everything for him before now.\n",
      "For many members of the House of Representatives and , indeed,for those who have had cause to relate with Hon.Miriam Onuoha,she is not only qualified, but capable to deliver on the demands of the Office she seeks to have.She remains a highly experienced leader ,who will even be humbler in the job that she seeks to be entrusted with.She relates well with everyone, despite status, tongue or religion.No wonder, therefore, that she is greatly loved by all among her constituents , colleagues and even the new Members- elect. Despite starting out with her quest for Speaker,today Hon. Onuoha is generally more acceptable and tipped as the preferred aspirant for the Deputy Speakership position of the House. It is the result of this that has set her opponent’s camp in disarray to unleash what we are currently seeing in the global media space against her ambition and her person. And to put it mildly,in the days leading to the inauguration of the new Assembly,we cannot but expect more of such campaigns of calumny and character-assasination.She has, however, insisted that she will never lose focus with all that and will keep her eyes perpetually on the big picture. Our humble advise to all traducers of Hon. Benjamin Kalu’s hue and temperament remains , however, to retrace their steps and play politics by the rules of the game.\n",
      "In conclusion,without doubts,in the last two months or so since the race for Presiding Officers’ positions with regards to the 10th National Assembly commenced in earnest,the Rt. Hon. Miriam Odinaka Onuoha Campaign Organisation has continued to hold itself out as a highly focused and pragmatic platform that never seeks to join issues with anyone,let alone be caught on the wrong side of decorum with any lawmakers-elect, especially,in the knowledge that the National Assembly election is an internal activity among colleague lawmakers-elect,who ought to be working with the sole vision to serve our dear country at a level requiring a lot of tart, maturity, dignity, intelligence as well as humility!\n",
      "The foregoing has always informed the need for us, in line with the noble qualities of our principal, to maintain an avowed stoical silence against any issues that might send the wrong signals about who we are. But,alas,in the past few weeks,the media space is starting to breathe with all manner of write-ups,innuendos, mudslinging and invectives against the highly intelligent,mature,humble and easygoing woman,who has continued to worm herself steadily in the last three years into the hearts of many lawmakers, Constituents and other national leaders across the country,using her signature banners of hard work,sheer brilliance, effervescent charisma and, again, humility,the temptation is to throw back darts for darts,but we have vowed not wrestle with any pig that wants to leave the wring in dirty apparels. However,there is always a limit to virtues like patience. We, therefore, count on the understanding of all co- contestants for different leadership positions of the 10th House to realize that this is a quest for national service and re-iterate our call on them to note that the quest for positions will, eventually, end , but the acrimony that may be left behind may endure longer than we may have ever envisaged.\n",

      "“To the surprise of many but not to ourselves, we have more firmly established this land as a democracy in both word and deed,” he said.\n",

      "SECURITY\n",
      "Security shall be the top priority of our administration because neither prosperity nor justice can prevail amidst insecurity and violence.\n",
      "To effectively tackle this menace, we shall reform both our security doctrine and its architecture.\n",
      "We shall invest more in our security personnel, and this means more than an increase in number. We shall provide, better training, equipment, pay and firepower.\n",
      "THE ECONOMY\n",
      "On the economy, we will target a higher GDP growth and to significantly reduce unemployment.\n",

      "Rural incomes shall be secured by commodity exchange boards guaranteeing minimal prices for certain crops and animal products. A nationwide programme for storage and other facilities to reduce spoilage and waste will be undertaken.\n",
      "Agricultural hubs will be created throughout the nation to increase production and engage in value-added processing. The livestock sector will be introduced to best modern practices and steps taken to minimize the perennial conflict over land and water resources in this sector.\n",
      "Through these actions, food shall be made more abundant yet less costly. Farmers shall earn more while the average Nigerian pays less.\n",
      "INFRASTRUCTURE\n",
      "We shall continue the efforts of the Buhari administration on infrastructure. Progress toward national networks of roads, rail and ports shall get priority attention.\n",
      "FUEL SUBSIDY\n",
      "We commend the decision of the outgoing administration in phasing out the petrol subsidy regime which has increasingly favoured the rich more than the poor. Subsidy can no longer justify its ever-increasing costs in the wake of drying resources. We shall instead re-channel the funds into better investment in public infrastructure, education, health care and jobs that will materially improve the lives of millions.\n",
      "MONETARY POLICY\n",
      "Monetary policy needs thorough housecleaning. The Central Bank must work towards a unified exchange rate. This will direct funds away from arbitrage into meaningful investment in the plant, equipment and jobs that power the real economy.\n",
      "Interest rates need to be reduced to increase investment and consumer purchasing in ways that sustain the economy at a higher level.\n",
      "Whatever merits it had in concept, the currency swap was too harshly applied by the CBN given the number of unbanked Nigerians. The policy shall be reviewed. In the meantime, my administration will treat both currencies as legal tender.\n",
      "FOREIGN POLICY\n",
      "Given the world in which we reside, please permit a few comments regarding foreign policy.\n",
      "The crisis in Sudan and the turn from democracy by several nations in our immediate neighbourhood are of pressing concern.\n",
      "As such, my primary foreign policy objective must be the peace and stability of the West African subregion and the African continent. We shall work with ECOWAS, the AU and willing partners in the international community to end extant conflicts and to resolve new ones.\n",
      "As we contain threats to peace, we shall also retool our foreign policy to more actively lead the regional and continental quest for collective prosperity.\n",

      "The outcome reflected the will of the people. However, my victory does not render me any more Nigerian than my opponents. Nor does it render them any less patriotic.\n",
      "They shall forever be my fellow compatriots. And I will treat them as such. They represent important constituencies and concerns that wisdom dare not ignore.\n",
      "Some have taken their concerns to court. Seeking legal redress is their right and I fully defend their exercise of this right. This is the essence of the rule of law.\n",
      "Over six decades ago, our founding fathers gave bravely of themselves to place Nigeria on the map as an independent nation.\n",
      "We must never allow the labor of those who came before us to wither in vain but to blossom and bring forth a better reality.\n",
      "Let us take the next great step in the journey they began and believed in.\n",
      "Today, let us recommit our very selves to placing Nigeria in our hearts as the indispensable home for each and every one of us regardless of creed, ethnicity, or place of birth.\n",
      "My supporters, I thank you. To those who voted otherwise, I extend my hand across the political divide. I ask you to grasp it in national affinity and brotherhood. For me, political coloration has faded away. All I see are Nigerians.\n",
      "May we uphold these fitting and excellent notions as the new Nigerian ideal.\n",
      "My fellow compatriots,\n",
      "The Nigerian ideal which I speak of is more than just an improvement in economic and other statistics. These things are important; but they can never convey the fullness of our story.\n",
      "Our mission is to improve our way of life in a manner that nurtures our humanity, encourages compassion toward one another, and duly rewards our collective effort to resolve the social ills that seek to divide us.\n",
      "Our constitution and laws give us a nation on paper. We must work harder at bringing these noble documents to life by strengthening the bonds of economic collaboration, social cohesion, and cultural understanding. Let us develop a shared sense of fairness and equity.\n",
      "The South must not only seek good for itself but must understand that its interests are served when good comes to the North. The North must see the South likewise.\n",
      "Whether from the winding creeks of the Niger Delta, the vastness of the northern savannah, the boardrooms of Lagos, the bustling capital of Abuja, or the busy markets of Onitsha, you are all my people. As your president, I shall serve with prejudice toward none but compassion and amity towards all.\n",
      "In the coming days and weeks, my team will publicly detail key aspects of our programme. Today, permit me to outline in broad terms a few initiatives that define our concept of progressive good governance in furtherance of the Nigerian ideal:\n",
      "The principles that will guide our administration are simple:\n",
      "1. Nigeria will be impartially governed according to the constitution and the rule of law.\n",
      "2. We shall defend the nation from terror and all forms of criminality that threaten the peace and stability of our country and our subregion.\n",
      "3. We shall remodel our economy to bring about growth and development through job creation, food security and an end of extreme poverty.\n",
      "4. In our administration, Women and youth will feature prominently.\n",
      "5. Our government will continue to take proactive steps such as championing a credit culture to discourage corruption while strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the various anti-corruption agencies.\n",
      "SECURITY\n",
      "Security shall be the top priority of our administration because neither prosperity nor justice can prevail amidst insecurity and violence.\n",
      "To effectively tackle this menace, we shall reform both our security doctrine and its architecture.\n",
      "We shall invest more in our security personnel, and this means more than an increase in number. We shall provide, better training, equipment, pay and firepower.\n",
      "THE ECONOMY\n",
      "On the economy, we will target a higher GDP growth and to significantly reduce unemployment.\n",
      "We intend to accomplish this by taking the following steps:\n",
      "First, budgetary reform stimulating the economy without engendering inflation will be instituted.\n",
      "Second, industrial policy will utilize the full range of fiscal measures to promote domestic manufacturing and lessen import dependency.\n",
      "Third, electricity will become more accessible and affordable to businesses and homes alike. Power generation should nearly double and transmission and distribution networks improved. We will encourage states to develop local sources as well.\n",
      "I have a message for our investors, local and foreign: our government shall review all their complaints about multiple taxation and various anti-investment inhibitions.\n",
      "We shall ensure that investors and foreign businesses repatriate their hard earned dividends and profits home.\n",
      "JOBS\n",
      "My administration must create meaningful opportunities for our youth. We shall honour our campaign commitment of one million new jobs in the digital economy.\n",
      "Our government also shall work with the National Assembly to fashion an omnibus Jobs and Prosperity bill. This bill will give our administration the policy space to embark on labour-intensive infrastructural improvements, encourage light industry and provide improved social services for the poor, elderly and vulnerable.\n",
      "AGRICULTURE\n",
      "Rural incomes shall be secured by commodity exchange boards guaranteeing minimal prices for certain crops and animal products. A nationwide programme for storage and other facilities to reduce spoilage and waste will be undertaken.\n",
      "Agricultural hubs will be created throughout the nation to increase production and engage in value-added processing. The livestock sector will be introduced to best modern practices and steps taken to minimize the perennial conflict over land and water resources in this sector.\n",
      "Through these actions, food shall be made more abundant yet less costly. Farmers shall earn more while the average Nigerian pays less.\n",
      "INFRASTRUCTURE\n",
      "We shall continue the efforts of the Buhari administration on infrastructure. Progress toward national networks of roads, rail and ports shall get priority attention.\n",
      "FUEL SUBSIDY\n",
      "We commend the decision of the outgoing administration in phasing out the petrol subsidy regime which has increasingly favoured the rich more than the poor. Subsidy can no longer justify its ever-increasing costs in the wake of drying resources. We shall instead re-channel the funds into better investment in public infrastructure, education, health care and jobs that will materially improve the lives of millions.\n",
      "MONETARY POLICY\n",
      "Monetary policy needs thorough housecleaning. The Central Bank must work towards a unified exchange rate. This will direct funds away from arbitrage into meaningful investment in the plant, equipment and jobs that power the real economy.\n",
      "Interest rates need to be reduced to increase investment and consumer purchasing in ways that sustain the economy at a higher level.\n",
      "Whatever merits it had in concept, the currency swap was too harshly applied by the CBN given the number of unbanked Nigerians. The policy shall be reviewed. In the meantime, my administration will treat both currencies as legal tender.\n",
      "FOREIGN POLICY\n",
      "Given the world in which we reside, please permit a few comments regarding foreign policy.\n",
      "The crisis in Sudan and the turn from democracy by several nations in our immediate neighbourhood are of pressing concern.\n",
      "As such, my primary foreign policy objective must be the peace and stability of the West African subregion and the African continent. We shall work with ECOWAS, the AU and willing partners in the international community to end extant conflicts and to resolve new ones.\n",
      "As we contain threats to peace, we shall also retool our foreign policy to more actively lead the regional and continental quest for collective prosperity.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "This is the proudest day of my life. But this day does not belong to me. It belongs to you, the people of Nigeria.\n",
      "On this day, Nigeria affirms its rightful place among the world’s great democracies. There, Nigeria shall reside forever.\n",
      "The course of our past and the promise of the future have brought us to this exceptional moment.\n",
      "In this spirit, I ask you to join me in making Nigeria a more perfect nation and democracy such that the Nigerian ideal becomes and forever remains the Nigerian reality.\n",
      "With full confidence in our ability, I declare that these things are within our proximate reach because my name is Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and I am the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n",
      "May God bless you and May He bless our beloved land.\n",

      "Aregbesola Champions Easier Path to Naturalisation, Announces Brown Card For Permanent Residency \n",
      "28 May 2023\n",
      "https://podiumreporters.com/index.php/2023/05/28/aregbesola-champions-easier-path-to-naturalisation-announces-brown-card-for-permanent-residency/\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign nationals with exceptional talent or those of African descent that wish to make Nigeria their home and those who desire to invest in Nigeria now can become Nigerians through a legal instrument called “The Brown Card.” This was announced by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, on Saturday, 27th May 2023 in Abuja during a ceremony to confer Nigerian Citizenship on 385 deserving adult foreign nationals from different countries.\n",
      " \n",
      "At the event, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister explained that although the Buhari administration approved the highest number of naturalised citizens in the country’s history, he was unhappy with the number and sought alternative paths for deserving foreigners to gain the right to become Nigerians. Ogbeni Aregbesola was emphatic that having smoother paths to citizenship for worthy foreigners is a great way to make Nigeria prosperous. \n",
      "In his words, “One of the objectives of this administration is to lay a solid socio-economic and political foundation that will elevate Nigeria into one of the 20 great economies of the world. To achieve this global vision, the government is determined to encourage and attract foreigners – investors, resourceful individuals and people with rare talents and unbounded energy – into the country.\n",
      "“Under our administration, the largest number of foreigners have been naturalised. Between 2011 and 2013, a total of 266 foreigners became Nigerians. In 2017, 335 people took up Nigerian citizenship. But last year, 286 foreigners and today at this ceremony, 385, making a total of 1006 have acquired Nigerian citizenship.\n",
      "“I am still not pleased with this figure. In Europe and America, thousands of foreigners are inducted into citizenship every year. They do this to attract youths and people in their prime who would like to contribute to the development of their countries. Let’s face it. There is a limit to your expectations from a non-citizen and it is reasonable to expect an average person to be more loyal to his or her country.\n",
      "“The bane of the smooth pathway to Nigerian citizenship however is the constitutional requirement of continuous residency in Nigeria for 15 years. This is a huge disincentive, considering that in the United States and most European countries, it is five years. Some of these countries have made a habit of snatching young and resourceful brains, through easy pathways, to obtain quality migration to their countries.\n",
      "“I will therefore urge the relevant institutions of state to reconsider this in the next effort at amendment to the constitution. We ought to have easier pathways to citizenship for foreigners than currently obtains.”\n",
      "The Minister also said it was imperative for Nigeria to make it easy for foreigner husbands of Nigerian women to gain citizenship. He also explained what led to the emergence of the Brown Card.\n",
      "“My Ministry sought and got the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council, to execute new pathways to permanent residency for eligible foreign nationals. I am happy therefore to announce the Brown Card, as the legal instrument to Permanent Residency.\n",
      "“The Minister of Interior is now invested with the authority to confer Permanent Residency on non-Nigerian persons, enabling such beneficiaries to live and work in Nigeria without the requirement of renewal every five years, as was the case.”\n",
      "Ogbeni Aregbesola said those who are qualified for this new instrument of Permanent Residency are as follows:\n",
      "1. Foreign nationals of African descent who desire to make Nigeria their homeland through the ‘Privilege of Return’\n",
      "2. Foreign nationals who desire to invest in Nigeria in line with established guidelines\n",
      "3. Foreign nationals who had demonstrated exceptional talents, knowledge and skills in rare fields of Science, Technology, Medicine, Engineering, the Arts, Sports and other areas as might be determined from time to time.\n",
      "4. Male foreign nationals married to Nigerian women for a minimum period of one year.\n",
      "The specific details for application and processing will be announced later by the Ministry of Interior and Nigeria Immigration Service.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ahead of the May 29 Presidential Inauguration, former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Bode George has said that he has forgiven President-elect, Bola Tinubu.\n",
      "Chief George also said that as someone who has been trained by the country, he would always give back to it even if called to work in Tinubu’s administration. \n",
      "The PDP chieftain said this in a recent chat with journalists at his Ikoyi office.\n",
      "Reviewing the outgoing Buhari’s administration, he berated it for failing to provide security which was its core responsibility.\n",
      "He asserted that in such regard, the President’s administration qualifies to be called a failure.\n",
      "He said: “My personal assessment is that he failed, not completely in every sector, but if you do an examination and say you must have a minimum of 33 per cent, then you can go to the next class, but they did not attain that 33 per cent. I can give them maybe about five per cent, even the five per cent requires a lot of retrospection. The most important thing you must guarantee to your people, as a government, is security of lives and property, who is safe now?\n",
      "“So it is very very disheartening and heartbreaking that he failed in his number one job, which is to guarantee security of lives and property. You know when he was coming in, oga (Buhari) was telling us, I would fight corruption, I will secure the lives and properties of the people, I will do this, I will do that, all kinds of promises.\n",
      "“So let’s put those promises now into his departure, because that’s what will be written on the pages of history. Whatever a leader does during his time, it is on the pages of history.”\n",
      "On whether he would work with Tinubu if called upon, he replied: “There is nothing personal, this country trained me and I have to give back.”\n",
      "He added, “I have forgiven him, but you cannot forget.”\n",
      "Recall Chief George was one of the popular traducers of Tinubu’s ambition for the presidency.\n",
      "The PDP leader had even avowed to relocate to a foreign country, specifically Togo, if Tinubu won the presidential election.\n",
